<blockquote>
<p>In 2005 at e3 Sony released a Killzone 2 gameplay trailer they claimed was running on a PS3. Which was clearly a pre-rendered video especially because Guerrilla Games had only just received the PS3 dev kits. A lot of people called bull on that. Same shit happened with Madden 06. Now this wasn&rsquo;t the first time game companies had pulled this shit but this was right at the point Internet video had gone mainstream and the term bullshot was created because of those videos so I had a little hope this had enough momentum to stop this in its tracks. Of course I was wrong, really wrong. The games weren&rsquo;t punished in sales for blatant lies and their franchises just got bigger and bigger. And game companies to this day keep putting out bullshots.</p>

<p><strong>Gamers as a group are dumb. You can explain things to them but you can&rsquo;t understand it for them. They complain all year that the e3 trailers didn&rsquo;t match the games released and then when the next e3 comes around will blindly jumped back on the hype train. Pretty pictures will always trick gamers.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>During a telephone conference regarding settlement on December 4, 2019, counsel for Crytek noted that in addition to settlement, it was considering a motion to dismiss based on CIG’s recently served objections and responses to Crytek’s Interrogatories.</p>

<p>Then, on or about December 11, 2019, Crytek’s counsel indicated to CIG’s counsel during a meet and confer that, based on CIG’s responses to certain written discovery, which Crytek contends revealed new information regarding the ripeness of one of Crytek’s existing claims, Crytek wished to voluntarily dismiss its claims against CIG without prejudice, with the intention of re-filing the suit against CIG following the release of Squadron 42 by CIG.</p>

<p>The parties met and conferred to discuss the terms of a stipulated dismissal, but they were unable to reach an agreement. Crytek intends to file a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice (the “Motion to Dismiss”) and CIG intends to oppose the Motion to Dismiss.</p>

<div class="poster">G0RF</div>

<blockquote>
<p>No Citizen is willing to entertain the thought, but at this point that Chris has everything to lose and little to gain by finishing and releasing Squadron.</p>

<p>He didn’t start out believing this obviously. Early on, he was confident he could deliver a great Wing Commander follow up. That confidence was absolutely destroyed in 2016. <em>Annihilated</em>. Infinite Warfare hit way too close to the mark, so close in fact that Chris’s all time biggest fan said excitedly of it “It’s great to see what a modern Wing Commander game from the industry could look like.”</p>

<p>Dogfighting, FPS missions, high fidelity cinematics, a classic “war story in space”. It was too damn close to the spec.</p>

<p>It’s 2020 now, and Chris still doesn’t have the talent to catch up with a COD release from 2016. And of course he doesn’t have to just catch up, he has to exceed it in every way possible. He’s had so much more time, so much more money, a huge Hollywood roster and worst of all, Chris explicitly said in 2014 Squadron would be “like a Call of Duty campaign but better because we’ve got a much bigger campaign!”</p>

<p>The bar is too high to clear now and it keeps going up while Squadron goes nowhere. Chris can’t clear it and knows it but can’t admit it publicly or else the whole thing falls apart and destroys him. (And God help him if the British tax office figures out how he played them)</p>

<p>He has more incentives now to engineer Squadron’s demise than its release. He need only find another party he can blame for it. Crytek backing away from a pre-release court fight is hilarious because there was already a decent circumstantial case that Chris and Ortwin wanted to make <em>them</em> the scapegoat. Maybe THAT’s part of what discovery turned up?</p>

<p>I mean I <em>suppose</em> there’s a chance Crytek thinks CIG might actually release it some day, and if so, they can either get more dough or do more harm by waiting for that day. But it’s hard to believe discovery might’ve turned up proof that Squadron was really looking good for release. If that exists, then why on earth would Chris be telegraphing the very opposite with Roadmaps?</p>

<p>I for one would like to thank Clive Calder for making this era possible. Even though things have gotten duller since Chris went into hiding, there’s still all kinds of potential for nutty outcomes bubbling up in the background. Absent Calder’s money we’d be watching this all slowly deflate, but with it, the hope remains we might get the full on debacle this story deserves one day.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="poster">G0RF</div>

<blockquote>
<p>So once again, their narrative is crumbling. Things on Squadron are not “going really well.” The Beta is not coming in summer 2020. They’re not sure when it might even release, if it will release, nor do they know yet in what form it might eventually come, as a stand-alone retail title (as the backers, Calder, and Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs office has been told), or maybe just as a module within their sole game release Star Citizen (as Crytek and Judge Gee have been told.)</p>

<p>Only a savant level huckster like Chris Roberts could find himself in such a fantastic bind.</p>
