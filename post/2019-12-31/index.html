Now this wasn&rsquo;t the first time game companies had pulled this shit but this was right at the point Internet video had gone mainstream and the term bullshot was created because of those videos so I had a little hope this had enough momentum to stop this in its tracks. Of course I was wrong, really wrong. The games weren&rsquo;t punished in sales for blatant lies and their franchises just got bigger and bigger. And game companies to this day keep putting out bullshots.</p><p><strong>Gamers as a group are dumb. You can explain things to them but you can&rsquo;t understand it for them.

Early on, he was confident he could deliver a great Wing Commander follow up. That confidence was absolutely destroyed in 2016. <em>Annihilated</em>. Infinite Warfare hit way too close to the mark, so close in fact that Chris’s all time biggest fan said excitedly of it “It’s great to see what a modern Wing Commander game from the industry could look like.”</p><p>Dogfighting, FPS missions, high fidelity cinematics, a classic “war story in space”. It was too damn close to the spec.</p><p>It’s 2020 now, and Chris still doesn’t have the talent to catch up with a COD release from 2016. And of course he doesn’t have to just catch up, he has to exceed it in every way possible. He’s had so much more time, so much more money, a huge Hollywood roster and worst of all, Chris explicitly said in 2014 Squadron would be “like a Call of Duty campaign but better because we’ve got a much bigger campaign!”</p><p>The bar is too high to clear now and it keeps going up while Squadron goes nowhere. Chris can’t clear it and knows it but can’t admit it publicly or else the whole thing falls apart and destroys him. (And God help him if the British tax office figures out how he played them)</p><p>He has more incentives now to engineer Squadron’s demise than its release. He need only find another party he can blame for it. Crytek backing away from a pre-release court fight is hilarious because there was already a decent circumstantial case that Chris and Ortwin wanted to make <em>them</em> the scapegoat. Maybe THAT’s part of what discovery turned up?</p><p>I mean I <em>suppose</em> there’s a chance Crytek thinks CIG might actually release it some day, and if so, they can either get more dough or do more harm by waiting for that day. But it’s hard to believe discovery might’ve turned up proof that Squadron was really looking good for release. If that exists, then why on earth would Chris be telegraphing the very opposite with Roadmaps?</p><p>I for one would like to thank Clive Calder for making this era possible. Even though things have gotten duller since Chris went into hiding, there’s still all kinds of potential for nutty outcomes bubbling up in the background. Absent Calder’s money we’d be watching this all slowly deflate, but with it, the hope remains we might get the full on debacle this story deserves one day.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/G0RF.gif alt="G0RF's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>So once again, their narrative is crumbling.

They’re not sure when it might even release, if it will release, nor do they know yet in what form it might eventually come, as a stand-alone retail title (as the backers, Calder, and Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs office has been told), or maybe just as a module within their sole game release Star Citizen (as Crytek and Judge Gee have been told.)</p><p>Only a savant level huckster like Chris Roberts could find himself in such a fantastic bind.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Scruffpuff.jpg alt="Scruffpuff's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/DD2Z9Tj.png></figure><p>I was positive … <em>positive</em> … that this was a photoshop.
