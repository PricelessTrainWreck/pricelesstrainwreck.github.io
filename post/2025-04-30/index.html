In gacha games the more you spend, the more you actively ruin the actual gameplay for yourself because it all becomes trivial but you&rsquo;re in the eco-system now and invested (insert sunk cost reference here). <strong>I guess it&rsquo;s a different neuron response to actually &ldquo;playing&rdquo; a videogame and I figure that&rsquo;s why the game itself doesn&rsquo;t matter so much to whales and that&rsquo;s such a perfect fit for Star Citizen. Even the gacha element is irrelevant really. If you are a mega-whale you aren&rsquo;t getting excited by the lottery mechanic because you&rsquo;re just going to keep spending until you get the shiny new toy. Star Citizen has you covered and saves you time by just making you straight up pay up for the new toy.</strong></p><p>Normally the whales will swim off for other shores when there isn&rsquo;t that large population creating a community for them to be a part of while having all the available toys etc. I&rsquo;m not really sure how the community is for Star Citizen.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>2023 Financials have been posted.

CIG have had staff hires in the past who could not adapt to these major differences, who moved on. A good place to start is by asking &lsquo;What problem were they trying to solve&rsquo;? The main problem they have always tried to solve s how to make systems and tools that can work at scales never even dreamt of in other games. If you know the limitations of other game engines and tools in these areas affecting scale it becomes fascinating to see their out of the box, even off the wall solutions. CIG aren&rsquo;t just making &lsquo;a game&rsquo; with a known engine and tools, they are designing tools that can produce more, faster than any other known.</p></blockquote><p>Every time a Star Citizen dev talks, it sounds like a TED Talk inside a black hole.

They spent so long just iterating on that one guy wearing seven jackets. They spent months talking about one single bartender.
