Just a couple of instances below:</p><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/plU4AT1.png></figure></blockquote><p><strong>Someone in the verse is probably interacting with the shop at the same time, and this thing broadcasts every action of every player to every client regardless of range and sublevel.</strong></p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>More likely is that everything is broadcast to everyone but the decision to show the dialogue is client-authoritative, and said client is chugging hard enough that it shows up for a split second before the client manages to figure out that it shouldn&rsquo;t be shown. The alternative was probably &ldquo;if we default to not showing the dialogue, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t show up at all&rdquo;.</p><p>Naturally this opens new and exciting future avenues for griefing. Competitive PvP games like Counterstrike, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft have a lot of special code server side to make sure things like &ldquo;positional data for people that your client shouldn&rsquo;t be able to see behind a wall&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t broadcast in the first place, to prevent client hacks like &ldquo;making the walls invisible&rdquo; from actually doing anything for you.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Sarsapariller</div><blockquote><div class=poster>Derek Smart</div><blockquote><p>We make fun of them for the lols, but we&rsquo;re now down to the point where we have to start taking this shit seriously because, you know, lives and bank accounts are at a risk.</p></blockquote><p>Explain to me how lives are at risk, though? Bank accounts I&rsquo;ll grant you, but really even if Star Citizen were to disappear tomorrow I kind of feel like the dudes who&rsquo;d invest their family&rsquo;s life savings into scam video games in pursuit of community and meaning are gonna find <em>some</em> way to lose that money.</p><p>I do think there will eventually be something that they declare as the final game. Years late, tens of millions over budget, and with mechanics that range from passable to holy-crap-how-did-that-ever-get-released. It&rsquo;ll be billed as an MMO but be largely played as a single player wandering-and-trading game, because they forgot to balance any of the economics to make piracy or bounty hunting worthwhile other than as griefing professions. <strong>It will be swiftly forgotten about within months as it is laughably far behind other games of the same period. The idiots who sunk 50,000 dollars into it will still feel justified because it came out, after all, and the amount they spent was so long ago that they&rsquo;re no longer feeling buyer&rsquo;s remorse.</strong></p><p>Only two questions remain for me at this point- how can they possibly put out all of the ships they&rsquo;ve sold, with all of the mechanics they&rsquo;ve promised, without going broke? And if they <em>don&rsquo;t</em> release them how can they cut and run having sold people stuff they didn&rsquo;t deliver?</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Ben he is just background Wing Commander noise on Twitter these days.

They sold this thing as a super up-gunned version of the Constellation with better shields, better guns, better missiles, a &ldquo;Point defense turret&rdquo; in addition to the two regular turrets, better armorâ€¦ it was supposed to be some kind of luxury VIP transport. Then they released the hangar version 2 years ago, and it was just a white version with a hot tub inside.</p><p>Now they&rsquo;re doing the inevitable &ldquo;Refactoring&rdquo; and literally all of the stuff I just mentioned has been dropped except for the hot tub. It&rsquo;s just a mangled version of the regular Constellation with less missiles and a fatter midsection to accommodate your frat parties. There&rsquo;s not even any gameplay reason for it to exist. But it still costs like $125 more than the regular versions- fuck you if you don&rsquo;t like it!</p><p>I would argue that this is not really a new kind of scam at all. It is a cult and a con. <strong>It turns out that cults have always been especially seductive to exactly the kind of people Star Citizen routinely preys on- loners with inferiority complexes who don&rsquo;t really have a lot of experience of what a healthy community should be. They get told that no they really <em>are</em> special, and here&rsquo;s a place for people just like them- give a little <em>more,</em> and you can enter at a higher rank- because if you can throw <em>that</em> kind of money around you&rsquo;ve obviously already earned the respect!</strong> The only thing they don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> have is a good messianic leader because Chris is kind of a fuckup and Sandi is a transparently evil grasper. I guess you could say <em>that&rsquo;s</em> the unique part- it&rsquo;s kind of a crowdsourced cult, where they all take turns &ldquo;Inspiring the faithful&rdquo; and nobody gets to sleep with the groupies because women are 100% repelled by this thing.</p></blockquote><p><a href=http://www.pcgamer.com/worst-microtransactions/>PC Gamer</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>The 10 most dubious in-game purchases</strong></p><p>Star Citizen: Land deeds</p><p>You can pay $50 to $100 for a claim to a plot of virtual land in a game that isn&rsquo;t out yet thanks to Star Citizen&rsquo;s land purchasing system that lets you secure a 4km x 4km &ldquo;lot&rdquo; or an 8km x 8km &ldquo;estate&rdquo; for your outlay. You don&rsquo;t need a land license to build in Star Citizen, but owning the land offers you protection against vandals, who will be committing an in-game crime for messing around with your private property.

Fixing that means fundamentally changing how systems work while simultaneously trying not to break everything in the game that uses them. Big performance gains that require making big changes take time. Sometimes we have to do a lot of restructuring before we can even start working on an optimisation. Making all these changes can introduce a lot of bugs, and fixing those takes even more time. Let&rsquo;s also not forget that performance is not the only goal here - we&rsquo;re also trying to achieve fidelity levels not seen before. Fidelity is often the enemy of performance, so we find ourselves having to optimize even further than we otherwise would have had to.</p></blockquote><p>Important clarifications from CIG!
