That&rsquo;s why they are talking about replacing state synchronization and remote method invocations with custom code.

More like they’ve held Chris’s buttcheeks to the lips after drinking Love Potion #9.</strong></p><p>More noteworthy — and stated in The Captain’s Table as well — are concessions on the part of these stalwarts of faithfulness of getting burned out on the game. I was too busy junkratting to note the time stamp, but I’ve heard this confession on multiple streams in the new year.</p><p>It’s not that we don’t know they’re burned out — they’re not playing the game even on their streams. They’re playing Tarkov, Sea of Thieves, KCD and other honest to goodness <em>games</em> even though so often we’ve read / heard the refrain “Star Citizen has more content than most AAA games I’ve played!”</p><p>Even as it’s becoming safer to admit sheer exhaustion from the 6 year cycle of overpromising, underdelivering, and theorycrafting to fill the yawning gap between the two, the old habits die hard. The shows spend very little time seeking anything like accountability. Theorycrafting fills the void of actual news. Lengthy discussions about footage and whatever gameplay they think it implies…</p><p>On that note&hellip; I guess at this point there’s no harm in sharing the letter I sent to Erris last year.. I’d attempted a dialogue with Jake on Discord but he and Dolvak jetted before I’d barely exchanged a couple of sentences.</p><p>Hopefully it’s at least good for some Goon laughs:</p><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/e4pObIx.jpg></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/3QHf9uQ.jpg></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/aiKhjbq.jpg></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/Mcblo5c.jpg></figure></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Star Citizer: REPENT YOU BOW-TIED HERETIC!!!</strong></p></blockquote><div class=poster>The Titanic</div><blockquote><p>This all came to a head when Beer4TheBeerGod went toe to toe with Sandi and made her dreams of being the smartest person in the room look very fraudulent. I feel like this hurt her because all along the way she genuinely started to believe the lies she told everybody around her about herself.</p><p>**There was a very distinct change at this period. Everything changed from &ldquo;this is personal to me!&rdquo; to &ldquo;its not personal at all and I don&rsquo;t really care what you think&rdquo;. (Bear in mind marketing people care, and people watching the money, because the <em>money</em> is the important aspect here. It&rsquo;s flow cannot be jeopardized and all hell will be refuted or backed up over if it looks like something slipped out that may jeopardize that flow.)</p><p>This is kind of an important bit though, because it gave them an ability to no longer care about what they were saying. There was no longer this responsibility feeling that &ldquo;yeah I&rsquo;m actually going to do this thing I&rsquo;m telling you because I think in my head it&rsquo;s not a lie at all!&rdquo; Now there can be lies, with not even an iota of thinking or believing they will ever be honored at all. There&rsquo;s not as much of a personal defense going on, and it&rsquo;s certainly not from CR or his wife unless it&rsquo;s some kind of a video they are starring in for YouTube and only to save the money flow as referenced above.**</p><p>This disconnect makes it easier to sell lies, distance themselves from the reality of the project vs the marketing needs of the project. It lets marketers go full on bullshit and the Roberts don&rsquo;t need to care or address it.</p><p>This is probably an important turning point in the project as well. It&rsquo;s where the game part stopped, and the marketing engine became important. It&rsquo;s why today we have land sales, and tank sales, and anything and everything else sales. The game <em>is</em> the marketing engine. Everything else is there just to support it, with the game itself on a constant maintenance mode that it will never get out of.</p><p>Even right now, they&rsquo;re probably working on another 100% fake demo that will look great either as a video or as &ldquo;people playing&rdquo; it. It&rsquo;ll never go public though, and no normal people will get their hands on it… but it&rsquo;ll create more sales, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important right now.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a high profile cash grab, with a ton of work put into marketing and faking progress, or outright lying about progress, and minimal work actually being done on the product itself. Just enough that it still looks like it&rsquo;s moving forwards, and trying hard to keep people from paying attention to time.</p><p>It&rsquo;s one thing to load up the game and see it&rsquo;s a wreck and say &ldquo;180+ million dollars, over 5 years development, a multinational staff across multiple studios with over 400 employees!&rdquo; and have people not go &ldquo;what the fuck are you guys really doing because this is not representative of that!!!&rdquo;</p><p>But if development time is always obfuscated, and it&rsquo;s always just starting, then it looks like great progress is being made.</p><p><strong>CIGs primarily marketing goal is information overload</strong>, and fact obfuscation. Be it about the status of the game or it&rsquo;s condition or what&rsquo;s coming next. You&rsquo;ll both never know, never be right, and somebody can always point you at some random video where they ironed out that exact question and you&rsquo;re a fool for not seeing it yourself.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/VirtualCaptain.jpg alt="Virtual Captain's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>You&rsquo;re 100% right about Sandi, she checked out a long time ago and it&rsquo;s frankly surprising there isn&rsquo;t more pressure from her to get SQ42 on more than just youtube demo reels. Maybe she knows the character and/or performance sucks.</p><p>But I don&rsquo;t think Chris was actively lying prior to 2016. He believes his own hype. He believes his schedules (except the ones he grandstands on stage). no feature is a lie when development will continue forever.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/TheAgent.jpg alt="TheAgent's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>!

I also think it will be clunky as all hell for years.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t follow the game other than what makes the news, but people voluntarily buy into the project so I say to each their own. I am,</p><p>however, surprised by the resiliency of people&rsquo;s faith. All that&rsquo;s left now is to see if ol&rsquo; Musky makes it to Mars before SC does.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I feel like the backlash of SC’s release will make No man sky’s launch drama look tame in comparison.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Open Development&rdquo; is not a magic shield towards criticism of the insane feature creep and constantly shifting release date this project has, along with the slowly increasing trail of MIA features and broken promises. SQ42 (only the first episode) went from a late 2015 release to &ldquo;At some point this will be finished&rdquo;, 3.0 didn&rsquo;t launch with a fraction of the features it was advertised to. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter how &ldquo;open&rdquo; this development is or &ldquo;No one has ever tried to do anything like this before&rdquo; when you are actively selling products to the consumer, and constantly having to walk back the features and deadlines that you sold them on in the first place.</p><p>How about the man stop making promises he knows he can&rsquo;t keep, and maybe the reaction from fans wouldn&rsquo;t be so negative all the time.</p><p>I&rsquo;m glad to be proven wrong, and if on release this game is everything the hype lives up to be, I&rsquo;ll gladly buy in and play. But dismissing those who haven&rsquo;t already paid, especially with the almost instant &ldquo;Do you own the game? Do you follow the weekly updates? Have you watched every con keynote?&rdquo; is sad. Because none of those actually alleviate any concerns that this project is ever going to finish in a reasonable timeframe.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The tactics used by CIG are not good. They&rsquo;re predatory in fact. Yeah other people are putting their own money into that hole and they&rsquo;re free to do that but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t be called out and others warned. I&rsquo;ve thought for a long time the management of this project has been horrible, the wrong things prioritized and championed, and they reached well beyond their means with the level of talent and tech they have. I feel even more strongly about that by what they&rsquo;ve shown and what I&rsquo;ve played. The term &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; is not a catchall or an excuse at this point. Basic stuff was worse off than how it was when I had played earlier. That&rsquo;s just insane and my PC is significantly better as well.</p><p>I do think some people are so finically and emotionally invested to the point where they can not see how bad it is. Some refuse to see how CIG is stringing them alone with promise after promise that gets broken almost every time. They simply can not push away from the table , stand up, and take a hard look around. That&rsquo;s not at all something that is limited to Star Citizen. There are many situations in life that result in the same thing. Be it other investments or personal relationships. In all those other situations it takes people from the outside looking in to see the real problem and even danger that exist and those involved dragged away for their own good. If this fails tomorrow I think people will better for it in the end.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Star Citizen lives in a very specific bubble and caters to a very specific niche audience that would probably cut off their own leg to get the game they are imagining.</p><p>I just hope the developers are not maliciously abusing of their patience and goodwill to feature scope the game until eternity until one day they close the shop. They created insane expectations and asked for crazy amounts of money throughout the years, they better deliver, even if in 12 years. They&rsquo;re playing with the hearts of &ldquo;obsessive&rdquo; fans who really want this to become real, if it doesn&rsquo;t happen I expect similarly vehement negative reactions by them.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Toatse.jpg alt="Thoatse's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/bgAZ84R.jpg></figure></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><strong>Worth Clicking:</strong><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=//www.youtube.com/embed/zUIJ3EO-Lv4 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><strong>(video: Erris fantasies about launching other steam games from inside Star Citizen)</strong></p></blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p><strong><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/806fcd/are_the_servers_worse_and_worse_everyday/>Are the servers worse and worse everyday ?</a></strong></p><p>i have the feeling that severs state is getting worse and worse fays after days.

This is in the structured universe where the UEE runs it and there&rsquo;s a lot of infrastructure. So one of these stations is right by a jump point so it gets all the information and then it will launch out a message drone or a messenger ship.

Few hours later, RSIi contacted me saying I had stolen ships and deleted my account. <strong>I have had a ticket open without reply from them and left with no account after spending over 4000$ total on those.</strong> How can they ignore more for almost 6 weeks ?</p><p>This is really starting to look like a scam from RSI, allowing transfer of ship that are supposely irreversible, and then locking account which paid for them.</p><p>I resent a message in the ticket but have got no reply. Am I really to hire a lawyer over this? Because I&rsquo;ll do, simply for the sake of integrity, if it needs to be done.</p><p>This joke has been going on for long enough, <strong>I paid thousands for those ships.</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/emotes/allears.gif alt="allears emote" class=sa-emote></p></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-02-26/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="February Set 7">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-02-28/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="February Set 9">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
