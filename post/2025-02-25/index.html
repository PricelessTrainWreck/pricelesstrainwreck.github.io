I remember logging in and just sitting in a ship that couldn&rsquo;t do anything and thinking &ldquo;this is going to be so cool when it&rsquo;s finished.&rdquo; <strong>The big joke back in the day was &ldquo;5 more years!&ldquo;… Yet the years have gone by, and the game seems just as broken as it was when we first got to jump in our ships and screw around at Port Olisar an laugh at all the bugs&hellip; we understood that there would be bugs - but that was 12 years ago and we still have game breaking bugs.</strong> I was so enthusiastic about Star Citizen I even gifted a starter package to a few of my friends - help the cause, right? They tested it and never came back.</p><p>After taking a break from the game for a while (since 3.18), when 4.0 came out I was very interested in testing out the Pyro system, and to see the progress on playability. I logged in and notice the game was running very smoothly, I&rsquo;d click on an elevator button and it worked! Then came the bugs. Requesting my ship in the hanger, ship comes up, then flips upside down, glitches through the floor.</p><p>Eventually I got to fly my ship, got to the Pyro Gateway - got my jump drive, here we go - let&rsquo;s go check out Pyro. Nope. My ship wouldn&rsquo;t acknowledge the wormhole so I went back to the station, stored it and checked to make sure the jump drive was installed. It was. I uninstalled it, saved it, then reinstalled it. Went to the wormhole, nothing. <strong>So can you imagine how frustrating this is to someone who has wanted this game for 12 years?</strong> Curse words were definitely flying way more than any of my ships. Eventually I did get to Pyro and went to check out Bloom. What a beautiful planet! I saw a town or city so I headed for it and started to land. I was immediately lit up by other players and destroyed. I respawned back on New Babbage. I took a deep breath and exited the game.</p><p><strong>I don&rsquo;t see this getting any better. When Global Chat works, people are expressing their disappointment over and over - &ldquo;This thing won&rsquo;t be ready for another 5 years….&rdquo; and there it was, full circle, the joke we all started out with was still a thing. &ldquo;Just 5 more years.&rdquo;</strong> In 5 years I&rsquo;ll be 57. I want to play a stable version of this game before I&rsquo;m NOT able to play it. That&rsquo;s ALL any of us are asking… but with all of the bugs - CIG, you&rsquo;re turning a lot of people away. So many people are turning away out of frustration and never coming back&hellip; and that&rsquo;s not a good thing. Give us something playable, please? I could see 1 or 2 errors or glitches - that would be fine, but what&rsquo;s happening now is game breaking and a lot of people are fed up. I know I am.</p></blockquote><h1 id=tony-z-retired>Tony Z retired</h1><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>reddit has realized that tony z is gone.
