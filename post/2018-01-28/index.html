People are tired of Star Citizen. No matter what they try to add, it will be the same non-game generic garbage (non-game generic <em>high-fidelity</em> garbage to be sure) and the game is already doomed to the scrapheap, regardless of completion status. Just not enough people give a fuck. I&rsquo;d compare it to Second Life, a game so niche and so insular that I have to check Wikipedia every few years to find out if it&rsquo;s still a thing. Star Citizen is consigned to the same fate at best. There&rsquo;s just no remaining interest in this title outside of the people who are already enslaved by it.</p><p>2) Related to above, too many excellent, functional, infinitely superior space games for those players who might have been interested in what Star Citizen promised, if only Star Citizen hadn&rsquo;t simultaneously promised everything and nothing at the same time. &ldquo;You can be a space farmer!&rdquo; &ldquo;Cool, how?&rdquo; &ldquo;Buy this module!&rdquo; &ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo; &ldquo;No idea. Buy it.&rdquo; Star Citizen would be shit if it existed in a vacuum - but in a crowded market, it&rsquo;s an industry-wide joke, poised to become an even better-known joke far outside the industry.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t possibly stress this enough, and the evidence backing this assertion is literally everywhere - in every CIG broadcast, in every fan stream, in every screenshot: <em>Star Citizen is not a game in development.</em> There is literally <strong>not even the basic starting building blocks of a game or a plan for a game.</strong> Star Citizen has nothing but graphical assets and motion capture. We&rsquo;re 6 years in and nobody on the planet, least of all at CIG, knows what this game is.</p></blockquote><p><strong><h2>Pingpong ball bug</h2></strong></p><p>There is a bug where character data gets corrupted in the serverside database and turns the player into a pingpong.

Are they writing that new… that new&hellip; you know like the PROCEDURAL PLANETS that EVERYBODY can experience&rsquo;, and&hellip; so that&rsquo;s always been&hellip; that&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s happened in those situations</p><p>But once all that stabilises of course we&rsquo;re gonna go and get that supported and when we&rsquo;re building things, you know, we&rsquo;re aware of like I said the DI&hellip; putting everything in the world itself, ah&hellip; which is quite friendly for VR or&hellip; you know&hellip; and moving your head around and TRACKING the same thing it&rsquo;s like&hellip; we track&hellip; ah&hellip; your HEADLOOK and actually, you know, I&hellip; I&rsquo;d thought that we&rsquo;d turned it on in 3.0 but it will be something that you can disconnect your LOOK from your AIM&hellip; as a PLAYER&hellip; ah, you know the AI can already do that&hellip;</p><p>Cos that&rsquo;s also something that&rsquo;s potentially useful where you&rsquo;re&hellip; you know&hellip; you&rsquo;re a CERTAIN way, you don&rsquo;t have to look around to like move your gun to look at it</p><p><strong>‘Star Citizen’ to Refocus on VR Support in Early 2016</strong></p><p><a href=https://www.roadtovr.com/star-citizen-to-refocus-on-vr-support-in-early-2016/>https://www.roadtovr.com/star-citizen-to-refocus-on-vr-support-in-early-2016/</a></p><p><strong>Chris Roberts:</strong></p><p>The status of VR integration is that we’ve been pretty busy with getting [Alpha] 2.0 [out] and we’re trying to get 2.1 so I would say we still have some stuff to integrate from the most recent CryEngine drops. They’ve been actually doing quite a lot of VR, I’m pretty sure you guys have noticed that they’ve completely doubled down and they’re all VR now.</p><p>So there are some updates on VR that we need to integrate in. It’s a little more complicated because we’ve changed the engine so much, we’ve changed the rendering pipeline to enable us to do a lot of things that we need to do so it’s not very easy. Nowadays we’ve diverged from CryEngine where we don’t take regular updates from them any more although we will cherry pick certain features that maybe we’re not working on that we think would help out well and VR is a good example of that.</p><p>So it’s really just a matter of getting some engineering time in the Frankfurt team. The Frankfurt team… [includes many of] the guys that originally did the VR work at Crytek so they know it pretty well but I would be expecting it to get up to speed with the most recent [VR] stuff sometime early next year.</p><p><strong><em>TL;DR:</em></strong></p><p><strong>2016:</strong></p><p>Frankfurt team will be up to speed on VR integration after we integrate new CryEngine updates into the base engine.</p><p><strong>2018</strong></p><p>We&rsquo;ll put in VR after we integrate Vulkan and X12 refactors into the base engine.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve transcribed Crobert&rsquo;s mind during that interview:</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Y9EYrSc.gif alt=https://i.imgur.com/Y9EYrSc.gif></figure></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Reading some Reddit comments from citizens reminded me of a pretty classic experience I had with this type of person.</p><p>I met this guy who told me he had been spending months designing a game. It was gonna be like Oblivion (this was before Skyrim had come out I think) but way more detailed, skill-based, other jargon (think &ldquo;fidelity&rdquo;), etc., i.e. the most Perfect Open World Sandbox Game Ever. He was super into the idea that every single action would be based on and/or influenced by your stats. So, for instance, a character with high Strength would probably open doors faster or something dumb like that.</p><p>He finally showed me the stuff he had actually written, and…. it was just pages and pages of lists of actions and the stats you&rsquo;d need in order to do them. Like, your character can do a Cartwheel! It&rsquo;ll require 10 Strength and 12 Dexterity! There was nothing about what a cartwheel would do, why you&rsquo;d want to do it, or anything like that. Nothing about what your goals in the game would be. Just hundreds of random actions and some made up numbers next to them. In his mind, this was the real meat of designing an epic game. It just needed some graphics and stuff slapped on.</p><p>Like with shitizens, I couldn&rsquo;t deny he had clearly enjoyed his time &ldquo;designing&rdquo; that game. I&rsquo;m just glad he wasn&rsquo;t paying anyone to enable his fantasy.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Posting on page 3600</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vEyMkly.png alt=https://i.imgur.com/vEyMkly.png></figure></blockquote><div class=poster>Derek Smart</div><blockquote><p><strong><a href=http://dereksmart.com/2018/01/star-citizen-the-fall/>Star Citizen - The Fall</a></strong></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-01-26/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="January Set 10">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-01-30/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="January Set 12">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
