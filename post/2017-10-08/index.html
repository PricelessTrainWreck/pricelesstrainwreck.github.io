Any ideas on where they might turn to? Elite? the new X game? No Man&rsquo;s Sky? Dual Universe? Beyond Good and Evil 2?</p></blockquote><p>Hold on to your panties though because this is going to blow you away.</p><p>Ok. Here we go:</p><p>The backers don’t actually play games.</p><p>They don’t even play Star Citizen when it iterates out.</p><p>The game they’re in is a meta social game, and they’re already playing it.</p><p>Star Citizen coming out would actually <em>hurt</em> the game they’re currently winning at and enjoying.</p><p>They won’t gravitate to another game because they <strong>don’t actually want to play the game</strong>.</p><p>What will eventually happen though is people will get bored. The ELE as it happens may just be the simple fact that they no longer want to spend money on lies. Once their buddies leave their discord’s, and the role play dries up, and there are too many holes in the lore, and the reality of the game solidifies, it comes apart.</p><p>I don’t have links to my blog, but I’ll say it again:</p><p>Star Citizen coming out and being developed will kill Star Citizen.</p><p>It’s fuel is the dreams and fantasies of 40-something’s who are fighting to rekindle a lost art they fondly recall from their youth. CR came in at almost the perfect time to capitalize on this midlife crisis group. Instead of buying their own Porsche’s they’re blowing their money on space ships.</p><p>The guys on reddit aren’t funding anything. They’ve already spent their meager amount of money and CIG can collect no more from them. Their defense also isn’t helping anything because the guys funding it ignore them too.</p><p>The mmo is happening right now. Once they win it, the money goes away. They won’t invest in another game either. This is the childhood memory game, and soon the midlife crisis will end.</p><p>As they get closer to leaving crisis, they’re going to want their money back, too. They’ll probably pay for lawyers as well because they have money to burn from successful and lucrative careers.</p><p>The other side of them are the people waiting for it to come out. 3.0 is “that turning point”. The group who isn’t role playing is waiting in the shadows for when their new Eve Online appears. They’ve been lead, oh so wrongly, to believe 3.0 is “that product”.</p><p>People are wondering “why stop refunds now? Why before unveiling 3.0 and their biggest achievement??? They’re spoiling their best, possibly last, big opportunity!!”</p><p>And I feel you’re only getting half the picture. The other half is what the evocati fuckers have, and are likely filling up their mail with problems. 3.0 is fucked, and it’s bad, and it looks like and plays like a joke of a game; not something a multinational company has been working on <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> for over 5 years.</p><p>This “stop the refunds now!” is a preemptive play to kill the silent majority of big money whales, waiting in the shadows, who have been paying all along, buying all the stuff, no doubt being fed lies about 3.0 in different methods of communication. Either special forums, private one on one email with their preferred employees, etc.</p><p>So really, there’s two fantasy groups who are huge benefactors who need to be stopped before they pull their money out.</p><p>1: The fantasy role players playing the game right now (and are almost done with it)</p><p>2: The silent majority led to believe 3.0 is where things get real and they can join in to the huge Eve-like mmo universe with a custom character and awesome fleet</p><p>Both groups represent huge $$$. Both are about to tucker on out or get real pissed.</p><p>Anyhow that’s my hot take. I’m sending this scoop to pixelemonade right now!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I was a Kickstarter backer and had nearly $500 sunk into this game. I pulled the handle last month and did a refund.</p><p>I would&rsquo;ve done a partial refund if they supported it (I honestly don&rsquo;t know why they don&rsquo;t) and just got back the money I spent on ships after Kickstarter, but since it was all or nothing, I went with &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p><p>If 3.0 comes out and delivers something not-terrible, I&rsquo;ll probably pick up a cheap ship package on sale, because I&rsquo;ll still play the game if it comes out. But I wasn&rsquo;t going to hang $500 on &lsquo;if&rsquo;.</p><p>Honestly, my decision to refund wasn&rsquo;t even totally based off of game performance and delays. It was because Star Citizen was not shaping up to be the game I was sold. I was sold on a game that promised to be closer to a simulator than not, but as of the last patch, they&rsquo;ve walked away from everything and it&rsquo;s just turning into a very good-looking, generic arcadey bullshit space shooter.</p><p>I backed a space sim, not Call of Duty: Lasers Pew Pew.

No-one could stomach ED in VR for more than 30 seconds because it fucked with their brain. No-one reported that they were fine with it. All reports said the game was currently unplayable in VR.</p><p>Fortunately, FD rushed out an emergency patch to fix it and everything was good again.</p><p>So the moral of the story - the VR implementation is highly sensitive, and needs to be done correctly, otherwise the experience is just nauseating.

At one point he was seriously considering in-game insurance adjusters whose job would be to go around and root out insurance fraud. I believe there was mention that it would just be a job any player could do, like any other mission. There were also some convoluted thoughts revolving around unique hull-numbers and the idea that if you stole a spaceship from someone you&rsquo;d have to go to a shady dealer to get the numbers filed off which would cost a bunch of money and be dangerous, until it was pointed out that that still didn&rsquo;t solve the issue.</p><p>As it currently stands in game ships are incredibly easy to steal. Once the &lsquo;owner&rsquo; opens the door even a single time it will open for anyone, but even if the owner isn&rsquo;t there yet, any ship that has a single turret is able to be entered by going to the outside of the turret and selecting the &ldquo;USE&rdquo; prompt that shows up because CIG can&rsquo;t figure out the clipping issues. In many cases getting into a &lsquo;locked&rsquo; ship is as simple as using your EVA nipplejets to thrust into it at full speed and magically clipping through the solid wall to the inside.</p><p>e: unless we&rsquo;re talking about some new news about CIG losing my credit card information or something, which in that case just lol</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>When the ship that your in</p><p>Starts to wobble and spin</p><p>Get a refund</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>when you bet all your chips</p><p>then the game never ships</p><p>you&rsquo;re a moronnnn</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>when da moon hits your legs</p><p>like expensive jpegs</p><p>thats fidelityyyyyy</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>When your game design bloats</p><p>Devs are mod&rsquo;ling three coats</p><p>You&rsquo;re The Chairman</p><p>When your hair looks like stoats</p><p>And you&rsquo;re sailing on boats</p><p>It&rsquo;s crowdfunding</p><p>Goons will parp tarp-a-larp-a-larp, tarp-a-larp-a-larp</p><p>And you&rsquo;ll sing fidelity</p><p>Whales will say early-early days,early-early days</p><p>Dreaming in futility</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Toatse.jpg alt="Thoatse's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>when it&rsquo;s 10 fps</p><p>and the netcode&rsquo;s a mess</p><p>that&rsquo;s cig</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>when your surfing pornhub</p><p>watching an old tickle rub</p><p>that&rsquo;s a sandy</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>When the moon hits your eye</p><p>like a big pizza pie</p><p>That&rsquo;s an Archer</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>When your codebase is crap,</p><p>And you shout, &ldquo;more mocap!&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re a Roberts</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/peter_gabriel.gif alt="peter gabriel's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>If your room smells of sweat</p><p>And you&rsquo;re thousands in debt</p><p>You&rsquo;re a backer</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/mmnn.gif alt="Toops's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>When you make Star Marine</p><p>Flush it down the latrine</p><p>You&rsquo;re Illfonic</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/cb.jpg alt="Colostomy Bag's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>When the funding is down</p><p>Because we employ clowns</p><p>Have a ship sale</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/cb.jpg alt="Colostomy Bag's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>Will Robert Space Industries provide us with a Carfax?

Space is just a janky module attached to it as a method of traveling between different FPS maps.</p><p>Funny enough, back when there was a “race to release first”, Star Citizen naturally failed, and CoD:IW has been out nearly a year now in another month.

Yeah, it’s almost done though!</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:American_Satan><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wdYbOP0.png alt=https://i.imgur.com/wdYbOP0.png></figure></a></p></blockquote><div class=poster>Derek Smart</div><blockquote><p>LMAO!</p><figure><img src=https://imgur.com/YlcRCvj.gif alt=https://imgur.com/YlcRCvj.gif></figure></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>The look when you only find out that your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/star?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#star</a> role as &quot;Vic&#39;s Mom&quot; was cut while attending film&#39;s premiere <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AmericanSatan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AmericanSatan</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarCitizen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StarCitizen</a> <a href=https://t.co/Y6LK4LxQPq>pic.twitter.com/Y6LK4LxQPq</a></p>&mdash; Ghandi Sardiner (@GhandiSardiner) <a href="https://twitter.com/GhandiSardiner/status/921007201757663232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2017</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>The look when you only find out that your #star role as &ldquo;Vic&rsquo;s Mom&rdquo; was cut while attending film&rsquo;s premiere #AmericanSatan #StarCitizen</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Scruffpuff.jpg alt="Scruffpuff's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>Sandi Gardiner, &ldquo;actress&rdquo;, being nixed 100% from her tour de force as &ldquo;Vic&rsquo;s Mom&rdquo; is the most delicious ending of the #actress #Hollywood saga that I can possibly imagine.</p><p>She hitched her wagon to Chris Roberts (again) and this project specifically to pad her IMDB profile, use backer money to create reel after reel of useless self-promotion, stand shoulder-to-shoulder with actual acting professionals, and get her face and name on a promotional poster with top billing alongside them.

Imagine being that bad.

Your money, that you gave us, is gone. It went to developing dreams; not yours, but the people in charge here. You paid for them to live out their dreams: Ben, who finally got to work with his idol; Sandi, who got back into acting; Chris who got to direct an absolutely stellar A list cast. For everyone else, you&rsquo;ve given them hundreds of thousands, if not millions, to pursue whatever they want to do. I&rsquo;m sure they thank you for helping them do what they&rsquo;ve only dared dreamed.</p><p>The rest of us politely say &ldquo;Stop emailing us asking for your money back.&rdquo; I know the official line is that everything is great and we are making money like crazy, but it&rsquo;s not. <strong>Things here are dire. They&rsquo;ve been dire for awhile but you can feel the shame and terror every time you walk into the building.</strong> I know this is coming off harsh. I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m sick of working here and I&rsquo;m especially sick of the whiny emails I continue to get. What did you expect?</p><p>I cashed out four months ago via GM. If you can sell a ship to a buyer, take it. Take it for half. Just take it.</p><p>You can also email and ask for a partial refund for 10%. Those we will approve without a problem, although it might take six or eight weeks to process now. Otherwise, stop asking, stop emailing and stop whining. Just stop.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><ul><li>Refunds delayed</li><li>New concept ship name and price revealed (Pioneer, $850)</li><li>Sandi&rsquo;s bit part cut from theatrical release of American Satan seemingly without her knowledge, which apparently is a bad movie anyway</li><li>AtV shows 16+ people meetings about doors and UI elements that are &ldquo;finicky&rdquo;</li><li>TheAgent with a possible employee e-mail venting frustration over refunds</li></ul><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2017-10-06/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=2017-10-06>&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2017-10-10/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All Time Greatest Posts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
