I <em>was</em> surprised that it didn‚Äôt get purged from the subreddit ‚Äî it sure won‚Äôt be tolerated on Spectrum. Then again, moderator Dolvak is talking a lot more about CIG and accountability these days. I‚Äôd not at all be surprised if he laughed long and hard at the video and would resist demands it be removed.</p><p>The industry microtransaction backlash was so massive and still <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/81k556/kotaku_after_the_star_wars_controversy_the_people/?st=JEEEDT3U&amp;sh=2401a2bd">generates so much animated discussion.</a> The shellshock is palpable.

First we&rsquo;re going to motion capture the IT guy laying cable, then we&rsquo;re going to motion capture some people using the internet. We&rsquo;re going to run these things together until the motion capture resolves the issues for us.</p><p>We&rsquo;re pretty confident this is going to work, but the only way to realize that goal is to stay on top of the motion capture market pretty much to the brink of insanity and maybe a lot further. The only thing that&rsquo;s going to really make this video movie happen is the motion capture, and the animation, and the intricate graphics.</p><p>This is our middle finger to all the lame, scared developers who are stuck in the box of <em>&ldquo;wah wah I need my low polygon assets to function because of my high network traffic load&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;wah wah I want my models to have proper lod and utilize normal mapping technology&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;wah wah I want my AI to be almost as smart as a real human but not quite because I&rsquo;m too scared to actually do it&rdquo;</em> and of course my favorite <em>&ldquo;wah wah lets just use basic graphics and figure out how the game will play before we start in on making expensive models and animation.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Well let me just tell you that your weak minded ways aren&rsquo;t going to pull movies into the next generation of video computer technology. Your 1980&rsquo;s think is gone, and this is the new fucking generation where Voodoo cards are here to fucking stay and I know you got run over at the pass there with your weak knowledge and fearful methods of not just <em>doing it</em> (lookin at you Rockstar you &ldquo;almost as good as us&rdquo; developers)!</p><p>So I&rsquo;m happy to say that we&rsquo;re going to motion capture bar and raise it as much as Roy can raise his arms because also fuck your IK bullshit in this real world. If a real person can&rsquo;t do it it&rsquo;s not Star Citizen. If it can&rsquo;t be motion captured it&rsquo;s not Star Citizen. If it is a game with depth and functionality it&rsquo;s not Star Citizen. So get your heads out of your collective behinds and get ready for the motion capture event of this next upcoming decade because let me tell you how much stock CryEngine is going to be awesome in another 7 years when we can release a non playable (are you stupid? If it&rsquo;s playable it&rsquo;s not Star Citizen) demo your socks will be blown the fuck off.</p><p>We are motion capturing trees and water, and also blood splatters. Have you ever motion captured blood before? I think not because you don&rsquo;t know how to develop games. So stand out of the way big companies and hold my fucking ping pong ball laced beer because we&rsquo;re about to kill it.</p><p>So here&rsquo;s our latest Jira roadmap:</p><p>2 weeks: Remotion capture internet traffic</p><p>1 month: Motion capture humans for their AI</p><p>1 month: Rework skeleton for motion capture 3.0</p><p>1.2 months: Motion capture all the missions of Sq42</p><p>2 months: Chump run</p><p>2.5 months: Motion capture motion capture because this is how you build a system smart enough to build itself with procedural motion capturing</p><p>3 months: Motion capture 3.1</p><p>3.5 months: Release all the video game movies and cash in</p><p>So there you have it. This is our roadmap and as you can see we&rsquo;re releasing everything in less than six months. In fact by month 6 we&rsquo;re releasing the first DLC pack that will connect your computer to your webcam so you can motion capture yourself watching YouTube videos of us watching our videos of our game in action. How awesome will that be?</p><p>Well you&rsquo;ll know soon, friend. Because we&rsquo;re doing it all here. We have the talent and the dubious and questionably legal shell motion capture studios around the world to pull it off.</p><p>So put on your ping pong balls and get ready to have your real balls blown away because this train can&rsquo;t be stopped, it can only be‚Ä¶ <em>captured</em>!</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/peter_gabriel.gif alt="peter gabriel's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/IsGe1gN.jpg></figure></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/G0RF.gif alt="G0RF's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p><strong>Anybody who can make it through the bootcha&rsquo;s video and not have any idea what is being said or why what‚Äôs being said might be alarming should definitely load up on some more spaceships.</strong> I recommend the Endeavor with the Science/Research/Telescopic modules, then they should proceed in an epic hunt throughout Chris Roberts First Person Universe for a clue.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt agree with you and have documented the matter pretty extensively.

The Alpha 3.0 infographic provided about does a decent enough job of summarizing the manner in which that particular deliverable was misleadingly oversold at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-3YBuFI3iI&amp;t=24m33s">Gamescom 2016.</a> What was claimed to include the whole of Stanton by December 2016 ended up 25% of Stanton a year later. It lacked many promised professions, did not include the ‚Äú30 to 40 space stations‚Äù, and was missing 3 planets and 9 moons.</p><p>Here is a more stark example:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8BL8gXjc54&amp;t=40m8s">Star Citizen Pax East Presentation - March 2015</a></p><p>There are a few things here worth pointing out. The biggest is the claim that Squadron 42 - Pt. 1 would release by end of 2015.</p><p>Chris Roberts hadn‚Äôt even shot his motion capture yet. Then as now, they still don‚Äôt have robust combat AI nor <em>any</em> combat AI for ground-based FPS. The flight model is still under serious revision.</p><p>Yet he made that claim up on the stage at Pax East 3 years ago and looked right in the camera and repeated it again on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXpx2C6rFAc&amp;t=2m33s">10 for the Chairman</a> the following month, further adding:</p><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/trustme.gif alt="trustme emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;each [Squadron 42 Episode] is the equivalent of a huge triple A &ldquo;Call of Duty&rdquo; or better because we have a much bigger campaign.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Rather bold talk and aggressive timelines, and of course we see now that he was either intentionally misleading or completely delusional. Was there any apology when Q4 2015 came and went without a release? No, instead, there was a cinematic trailer boldly claiming <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FF-ewiwmhs&amp;t=4m0s">2016</a> would be the year of Squadron 42. This too shall pass and did. We were then told to expect to see a <em>vertical slice</em> of a game that was supposed to be done in 2014 &amp; 2015 &amp; 2016 at CitizenCon 2016. Do you recall what happened to that vertical slice?</p><p>In case you don‚Äôt, CIG can refresh our memories. They pulled the slice altogether, and we got an apology documentary a couple of weeks later that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=9m13s">explained</a> they couldn‚Äôt get a stable slice together despite two months of work on it.</p><p>January of 2017 saw the illusion of good news as Chris Roberts gave interviews suggestive that Squadron 42 <a href=http://www.player.one/star-citizen-squadron-42-release-date-will-probably-be-2017-says-co-founder-chris-578071>was nearing completion for release in 2017.</a> But alas, for the fourth year in a row, his guidance was wrong.</p><p>At the end of 2017, we finally at least saw that vertical slice we were supposed to see the year prior. It openly states that the game is in Pre-Alpha.</p><p>It was beautiful, had some nice cinematic exchanges, along with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHR1aEdTA4M&amp;t=25m46s">protracted five minute stretches where nothing happened.</a> Given the incomplete state of AI in year 6, its probably not surprising that it‚Äôs hard to keep the pace up in the pre-alpha in between the movie like dialogue scenes. It‚Äôs a very safe bet that Squadron isn‚Äôt coming out this year either and indeed, not even Chris Roberts is claiming otherwise. After four years of being wrong, who can believe him?</p><p>As an aside, we also now have a frame of reference for what a ‚ÄúCall of Duty equivalent‚Äù campaign might look like because <em>Infinite Warfare</em> delivered what CIG Community Manager Ben Lesnick praisingly described as ‚Äúlike a modern day Wing Commander‚Äù experience a month after CIG failed to show their vertical slice.</p><p>There‚Äôs a tendency to make sneering dismissals of Call of Duty, yet as you know if you‚Äôve followed the community <a href=https://np.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/4o1qtx/lets_talk_about_call_of_duty/>discussions</a> about that title, reactions were far more complex. Despite the anti-futuretech backlash that Infinite Warfare met with from day 1, the actual missions and <a href=https://youtu.be/KjbwnggFxNw>campaign</a> dropped jaws at Sony‚Äôs E3 reveal. Critics <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0o5lJu4CUQ&amp;t=0m39s">praised</a> its World War 2 story in space straightforwardness, and the surprisingly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0o5lJu4CUQ&amp;t=9m03s">moving and downbeat story conclusion.</a></p><p>I would hope after this in-depth history lesson you might better understand why it is I used the term ‚Äúpathologically inaccurate‚Äù to describe their marketing. I recognize that many backers are happy to excuse this, happy to excuse the same handling of Alpha 3.0, happy to do the same for <a href=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/09/29/what-happened-to-star-marine-star-citizens-missing-module>Star Marine</a>, too.</p><p>Yet a high tolerance for inaccurate guidance shouldn‚Äôt be confused with the moral acceptability of it. There has never once been an apology for any of the aforementioned examples, yet if I were to treat another human being the way Chris has treated his backers I‚Äôd rightly be considered an unreliable flake unworthy of trust. It is unlikely you‚Äôd tolerate similar treatment from other products or services companies out there.</p><p>The contentiousness of Star Citizen debates is very much tied up in the collision of worldviews over the acceptability of such practices. Yet outside of the small bubbles where these debates rage, there are generally agreed upon notions about these matters. Most people looking at a project with a Troubled Development history and years of mismanaged expectations would not like race to the defense of the man primarily responsible for both. Particularly after learning he‚Äôs been given the largest independent game Development budget in history ‚Äî $180 million. After six years and that much money, expectations should be raised not lowered in commensurate degree.</p><p>As the old parable goes, ‚Äúto whom much is given, much is expected‚Äù and it seems to me, independent of whatever qualitative expectations might be merited, the right to expect honest guidance goes without saying.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>So Crytek suing CIG for breach of contract is a &lsquo;cash grab&rsquo;, but CIG selling land sticks and tanks is perfectly ok because <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> tasks on a basic networking feature after 9 months is &lsquo;progress&rsquo;</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76VwCNZvQ1g">* Sunk Cost Galaxy Episode 4 *</a></p></blockquote><p>Holy shit, 2014 onward got busy busy busyyy.

Jump/hang/bounce are absolute foundational pillars when making a new one.</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways, this method of finding your gameplay loops (metas, micros, etc.)and continually evaluating, tweaking, and adjusting them is (in my opinion) the way to do it. No one should be making any semblance of final content at this time. The art team should be extremely small (maybe an AD and a couple concept guys) and they‚Äôre just working on style guides and visual targets, while engineering and design are continually scrumming over loops, setting engine budgets for everything (with art etc) and developing the GDD so you don‚Äôt end of up with the perfect example of how to do it completely wrong on all fronts: Star Citizen</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><blockquote><p>It just mind-boggling how CIG approaches this, with finished game assets (that will have to be redone again and again, see item 2.0) but nearly no gameplay mechanics to speak of.

It‚Äôs definitely the absolute worst way to do things and have any level of predictability for your game. Essentially you make a shit ton of hi-res art to wow the publishers and buy some time. Then, behind the scenes in the studio, designers are ripping their hair out, having nervous breakdowns, or quitting because they can‚Äôt find a way to shoe-horn design loops into finished art - and are being blamed for everything. And meanwhile art is screaming about not wanting to redo all their assets, so, design better figure this shit out with what they have.</strong></p><p><strong>All the while, the product director or EP is yelling at design that they better hurry up and figure this shit out, because they are now blocking the (too many too fast scaled) art team from moving forward on the schedule and the games phase gate dates are starting to slip, and the burn rate is hovering at 2-3+ million a month. No pressure lol</strong></p><p><strong>Why it‚Äôs called lightning strike is because on the rarest of occasions - the designers find something that suddenly feels really good and then the game is saved by that hail mary/lightning strike moment.</strong></p><p>Perfect lightning strikes are ridiculously rare, and hence when you see studios shut down all the time: They most often went this route, and never got the magical bolt they were hoping would show up. Or, they hit a lightning strike early, had massive success, and could never figure out how to repeat it. Rovio comes to mind, along with a handful of other places that are trying to make a followup to a single smash hit, but have yet to repeat their original strike.</p></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-03-03/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="March Set 1">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-03-10/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="March Set 3">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
