THAT is why Sandy angers me. Don&rsquo;t call yourself a VP when failing at basics with no formal study or true industry experience: BEHOLD THE IMAGE.</p><p>What you&rsquo;ve done is every SEO &ldquo;brand reputation manager&rsquo;s&rdquo; dream.</p><p>The #1 request is: Something negative about me shows up on page 1. Realistically, given way algorithm works and signals it detects, hard for 95% of brands to fix it</p><p>too long to explain even though I spam you, and like NDA issues, but many brands are internal messes that prevent corrective action.</p><p>The thing is, it is often a link to an article A LINK TO AN ARTICLE. Not an individual showing up with his fucking mug shot on page one for a knowledge graph search on google.</p><p>Some of the client work I am dealing with now? They would have a heart attack if someone, an individual let&rsquo;s say a product critic with a well researched arsenal of content on his website showed up under their profile in the right hand bar as &ldquo;also searched for&rdquo;.</p><p>Not only your name shows up for also searched for, beautiful google algorithm quirks and flaws picked up your profile pic. This is a neutral, no history, opt out of all ads, doesn&rsquo;t browse view tool I use for keywords to see visibility for terms when not influenced by a logged in gmail account nor cookies from google apps and api bs</p><p>SIR YOU ARE SHOWING UP ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE GRAPH FOR BRANDED KEYWORDS.</p><p>That would cause a fucking crisis.</p><p>If Sandi, was a true VP of marketing, she would be all over it&hellip; the funny bit is, because &ldquo;link building&rdquo; is still a thing, the most &ldquo;authoritative&rdquo; alternate source regarding SC is you in the google algorithm&rsquo;s mind currently (sans some manual manipulation internally at Google)</p><p>So to fix their search situation, they would literally need to work with you as long as you keep your domain and site active.</p><p>New consumers searching for &ldquo;roberts space industries&rdquo; or &ldquo;star citizen&rdquo; will see your profile unless they take serious corrective action to protect the brand on search. Sandi isn&rsquo;t doing that. A &ldquo;marketing manager&rdquo; or director could do what that VP is not.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><div class=poster>Derek Smart</div><blockquote><p>Evocati 3.0.
