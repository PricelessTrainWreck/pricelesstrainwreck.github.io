<p>I think the best part of the Star Citizen Scam finally collapsing is that a large number of nerds will stop psychotically obsessing over Elite Dangerous being THE ENEMY and instead maybe shut up and enjoy the game that delivers on many of Chris Roberts promises.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there will always be people that refuse to play it because it dared to exist opposite of Star Citizen and ten years from now at any mention of Elite Dangerous they will scoff and go into a rage filled tirade about &ldquo;Polygon Tacos&rdquo; or whatever but I think that will be a small minority.</p>

<p>ED might see a nice boost once thousands of people stop saving themselves for space marriage.</p>

<p>I dunno I&rsquo;m optimistic at heart so it would be nice to see all the millions of dollars and thousands of players go toward an actual company with a proven product they continue to develop instead of a stammering idiot with a modded Crysis map promising the literal matrix to fools.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<p>It&rsquo;s the fanboy paradox.</p>

<p>They need Elite to exist so they can gloat at how much better Star Citizen is. But the fact that Elite is objectively the better one at the moment (by virtue of being real) is currently driving them fucking insane. I can&rsquo;t imagine what they&rsquo;d be like once you took the possibility of Star Citizen <em>ever</em> existing away from them, because that&rsquo;s basically their only lifeline to sanity.</p>

<p>The funny thing about 8 minutes is, I&rsquo;m a proponent of long travel times in online open world games, it&rsquo;s good for the non-combat part of economy play (trading with places far away from main hubs gets profitable since it takes a tiny bit of effort so most won&rsquo;t bother), but obviously star citizen did it all wrong.</p>

<p>On how to do this shit right, look at Freelancer. It&rsquo;s a bad game on many levels, but anywhere on your journey, you&rsquo;re hitting content. You see police patrols ganking you for cardamine, you see pirates interrupting the trade lane and scanning you for valuables, you see patrols fighting pirates, avoiding space rocks in space fog nebula, there&rsquo;s constantly <em>something</em> happening around your ship.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in star citizen it&rsquo;s just 8 minutes of fucking nothing. There&rsquo;s not even awesome nebula scenery or anything, it&rsquo;s just nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot of times if you see a lot of pitches and if you&rsquo;ve been working them on the publisher side a lot you kind of know what&rsquo;s feasible and what&rsquo;s not and you know what things are hard to do and what things are easy to do and <strong>if somebody comes in and says yeah we want to do a thousand person multiplayer game with real-time firefights then alarm bells go off</strong> and it&rsquo;s fine to do something that&rsquo;s really technologically ambitious it&rsquo;s fun to do something that&rsquo;s really dangerous and hard but if you say something like that that sounds dangerous and hard and then you don&rsquo;t explain how you&rsquo;re going to pull that off then that really makes people nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>#13 - You Polished Too Early <a href="https:youtube.com/watch=4LTtr45y7P0&amp;t=740">timestamped youtube link (740)</a> (12:20)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Part of the reason this image is in here this is from a game I worked on where we did like final art for all the ships before we had our combat modeled down and all the stuff got thrown out and so <strong>if a game is really really visually polished but the mechanics are still really broken in prototype that also is an alarm bell because it suggests that the team is not putting all the effort where where it should be and it also suggests that a lot of work is going to be redone.</strong> So again if you want to showcase what you&rsquo;re capable of in the art department that&rsquo;s great but make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t overshadow the fact that your your game in the prototype phase may still be really really incomplete. A few still images of show with your art team is capable of is much better than a prototype that is broken in a variety of ways but what that looks amazing because the person you pitching to knows that&rsquo;s all gonna have to be thrown out when the game actually gets nailed down so make sure that work in progress actually looks like work in progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is amazing to consider this when a Citizen mentions how far the game has come. Five years, $160 million, a company that has spread across the globe like a disease and all they have to show for it are videos that (at least to this layman&rsquo;s eye) look much the same as the original pitch videos. Where the fuck has that money gone? Ok, Porsches, cocaine and playing at movie making. Stupid question. I hope this whole thing does end up in court, because I&rsquo;d love to see Roberts desperately trying to explain how the 2017 videos are massive advancements from the 2012 pitch videos, and totally took up all that money.</p>

<p>How can they describe these bugs with a completely straight face? Either the coders are super good actors, or they are actually pizza delivery boys that were invited to stay.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;To see if the player has his cursor over an item in the store, we raycast the cursor against all the colliders in the entire universe. This causes a bug where the display case glass blocks the ray and the player can&rsquo;t select the item.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>1. You would just raycast the items near the player, not the universe. You&rsquo;re not shooting a bullet.</p>

<p>2. You don&rsquo;t want any level geometry to obstruct the item, anyway. It would make it hard to select an item that is partially obstructed.</p>

<p>3. Why not use a faster and easier selection system? The player has to painstakingly put the cursor right on the item&rsquo;s collider (which will be annoying if the object is small). You could literally just check if the cursor is within X pixels of the item on the screen, X changing with distance and item size. If the test intersects more than 1 item, use the nearer one, or the one that you clicked closer to it&rsquo;s center. User friendly and 1/100th the processing time.</p>

<p>4. Transparent objects would need to be on a separate collision layer anyway for when you code NPC vision AI, among other things. Collider layers isn&rsquo;t an unexpected crisis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first time I ever designed a system for picking up items, I had a problem. I couldn&rsquo;t pick up items if there was something in front of it. The raycast would hit the something first. Then I did a quick google search, read about object/collider layers, then I read about raycast filtering. I went back to my editor, set all items to the &ldquo;item&rdquo; layer, set the raycast so it could only hit objects that were members of the &ldquo;item&rdquo; layer. Problem solved in ~10 minutes. I have a terrible memory, and I remember it, so.</p>

<p>Am I supposed to believe CIG, a $160m company with world class game developers don&rsquo;t know how to do this? I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not a uniquely bright individual, and I figured it out.</p>

<p>Possible options:</p>

<p>1. Somebody just forgot to set environment object layers properly</p>

<p>2. The item 2.0 &ldquo;use&rdquo; raycast wasn&rsquo;t set to filter properly</p>

<p>3. It&rsquo;s a fake bug they invented just for the ATV segment</p>

<p>4. It&rsquo;s incredibly hard to do raycast filtering in CryEngine</p>

<p>Personally, I would be embarrassed sharing this as a &ldquo;hot take&rdquo; bug fix. It&rsquo;s either a silly oversight, or reveals shocking ignorance on the part of the CIG devs.</p>

<p>Thousands of dollars worth of man hours went into making this stupid ass video on how to pronounce this made up language in a jpeg simulator</p>

<p>The schedule report has a new format where they list &lsquo;bugs&rsquo; and &lsquo;tasks&rsquo; for each of the six remaining focus areas.</p>

<p>57 bugs and 254 tasks until <strong>PTU</strong></p>

<p>Keep in mind that all of the performance/stability issues are technically tasks, not bugs, and shopping went from 17 to 20 bugs overnight. CIG is dangling a new carrot in front of the backers, and have revealed how much information they have been holding back over the last couple of months. Keep in mind that they often add almost as many bugs as they solve, and that figure could easily end up being 200 bugs and 1000 tasks.</p>

<p>So let me start off by saying there is no bigger fan of SC than me. I am literally all in financially, emotionally and spiritually. This game is going to be the best game ever and quite honestly the one true game. That being said I have a slight concern and wonder if I am just being silly. The previous burn downs showed far less bugs/tasks than what we have now. If you sum the current list we are at 291 tasks/bugs. This is drastically higher than before. Like I said I&rsquo;m not bitching, whining or anything of that nature and I believe in star citizen to the point that I think I might be a zealot.</p>

<p>What do you guys think about the task/bug numbers growing so drastically?</p>

<p>[Citizens] together with CIG, they&rsquo;ve created a situation that keeps SEO specialists awake at night. Not that the best VP of marketing since she was a leetle gurl knows wtf she&rsquo;s doing anyway. So there&rsquo;s that.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DN0w8K7X0AA4zlh.jpg"

</figure>


<p>Someone sent me that image earlier, along with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Google algorithm has associated you with the knowledge graph and is now generating your profiles in relation to searches for the brand.</p>

<p>Honestly, in the &ldquo;SEO&rdquo; sorcery space… that means OWNED and would cause a crisis for brand rep. THAT is why Sandy angers me. Don&rsquo;t call yourself a VP when failing at basics with no formal study or true industry experience: BEHOLD THE IMAGE.</p>

<p>What you&rsquo;ve done is every SEO &ldquo;brand reputation manager&rsquo;s&rdquo; dream.</p>

<p>The #1 request is: Something negative about me shows up on page 1. Realistically, given way algorithm works and signals it detects, hard for 95% of brands to fix it</p>

<p>too long to explain even though I spam you, and like NDA issues, but many brands are internal messes that prevent corrective action.</p>

<p>The thing is, it is often a link to an article A LINK TO AN ARTICLE. Not an individual showing up with his fucking mug shot on page one for a knowledge graph search on google.</p>

<p>Some of the client work I am dealing with now? They would have a heart attack if someone, an individual let&rsquo;s say a product critic with a well researched arsenal of content on his website showed up under their profile in the right hand bar as &ldquo;also searched for&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Not only your name shows up for also searched for, beautiful google algorithm quirks and flaws picked up your profile pic. This is a neutral, no history, opt out of all ads, doesn&rsquo;t browse view tool I use for keywords to see visibility for terms when not influenced by a logged in gmail account nor cookies from google apps and api bs</p>

<p>SIR YOU ARE SHOWING UP ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE GRAPH FOR BRANDED KEYWORDS.</p>

<p>That would cause a fucking crisis.</p>

<p>If Sandi, was a true VP of marketing, she would be all over it&hellip; the funny bit is, because &ldquo;link building&rdquo; is still a thing, the most &ldquo;authoritative&rdquo; alternate source regarding SC is you in the google algorithm&rsquo;s mind currently (sans some manual manipulation internally at Google)</p>

<p>So to fix their search situation, they would literally need to work with you as long as you keep your domain and site active.</p>

<p>New consumers searching for &ldquo;roberts space industries&rdquo; or &ldquo;star citizen&rdquo; will see your profile unless they take serious corrective action to protect the brand on search. Sandi isn&rsquo;t doing that. A &ldquo;marketing manager&rdquo; or director could do what that VP is not.</p>

I think we just keep making excuses for them because we want it so badly to be real.

<p>I still desperately want to have faith in the project, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel like in February 2018, due to unforeseen circumstances, we&rsquo;ll be speculating April 2018 for the awaited content drop.</p>

<p>Supercruise was the DDF&rsquo;s (Frontier&rsquo;s sperg army) sole contribution to the game and is the dullest part of the game. In fact it&rsquo;s the dullest part of any game ever.

<p>just remember, some people have been in crunch mode for almost two full years now</p>

<p>the other ones, like some peeps that I know, straight up walked out after 3 to 6 months of that shit, mostly because there was no end in sight, no goal to reach to end the crunch and no rewards or incentives for your sacrifice</p>

<p>now you&rsquo;ve got 26 year olds leading entire teams with no prior game or managerial experience, working constantly because they have no idea its a bad thing. they take their cues straight from roberts on how to manage your employees: &ldquo;do what I say, exactly how I say, or quit&rdquo;</p>

<p>the tales that you&rsquo;re going to hear next year are going to fucking astound some people.

<p>at what point do you mention to the backers that you&rsquo;re financing film careers? that you&rsquo;re starting to broadcast yourself as a digital effects company, with access to superior motion capture and CGI technologies? don&rsquo;t you think someone on this great big internet is going to fucking find out about it?</p>

<p>I mean, I guess you can hope that the game comes out to rousing success before then, and of course, of course! hollywood and special effects are a perfect fit for chris roberts, so its no big deal he&rsquo;s spending a lot of time and resources and backer money doing hollywood things</p>

<p>but goddamn chris, y&rsquo;all playing with fucking fire</p>

<p>like hey, here&rsquo;s a bad thing: we are running out of money to develop a game</p>

<p>and yeah, we&rsquo;ve taken out a few loans and are really, really hoping no one looks too closely at this whole UK tax credit thing and yeah, yeah we are down almost 30% in revenue from last year so far</p>

<p>but also! intel paid for our last two shows, amazon floated us some monies and we&rsquo;re only a wee bit behind</p>

<p>but hey, here&rsquo;s a good thing: we got a fucking major cash injection from a movie production company to do their digital effects! the company is saved</p>

<p>also I need all the art teams focused on the movie stuff because we have a four month deadline for our portion of the vfx, but this is also okay because we need six months or so to get our programmers to finish our engine</p>

<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m fuckin&rsquo; proud of you, Chris. You aimed for the stars, missed horribly, and landed in the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</p>

<p>Let this be a lesson to you all. <strong>Got an idea? Just fucking do it. Find a way. Make it work. Always do, even if you&rsquo;re a complete fuck up. The universe loves action, it needs juice, and as long as you just show up and try, you win.</strong> Get off the fucking internet. Stop watching the fucking TV. Don&rsquo;t play video games, they&rsquo;re all just shit designed to keep you off the playing field. And NEVER let that nagging fuckster in the back of your mind tell you you&rsquo;re gonna fail.</p>

<p>Chris Roberts wins at life. He laughs all the way to the mobile banking app on his phone to check his auto-regenerating bank account balance. Scummy? Oh what the fuck ever. He played by the written rules and that&rsquo;s all that matters. Bad person? I don&rsquo;t know him, but he pays for his wife&rsquo;s movie dreams and gives all his friends jobs, and that&rsquo;s a hell of a lot more than most of us. Immoral? Didn&rsquo;t know you were runing the books on that one. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what. It&rsquo;s immoral to let people as stupid as Star Citizens, with their fucking cringecore stunted bullshit fantasies, keep their money. Who the fuck would wanna make a game for that lot of losers anyway?</p>

<p>Fuck em. Fuck you. And fuck me.</p>

<p>Chris Roberts is a genius, and he deserves to enjoy his Porches, because god dammit, at least he got up off his ass and tried.</p>

When I finally got the game to work, it suddenly wasn&rsquo;t as interesting. It was easy now. What had changed was that the game no longer required me to engage my imagination, and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re selling at CiG, a chance to engage your imagination.</p>
