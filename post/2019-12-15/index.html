Jared will laugh on camera at their expectations of a finished game in a less than geological timescale, Sandi doesn’t even bother to show up and half-ass justify her huge paycheck, and Chris mostly stays in hiding now.</p><p>I guess they realized that anyone still giving them money is so deep in their own dreams of a new life in space and sunk coast fallacy that they will defend CIG to the very end, and they just said “fuck it.”</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Sarsapariller.jpg alt="Sarsapariller's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s two phenomena that have allowed CIG to get away with the self-branding of &ldquo;Most open dev ever&rdquo;</p><ul><li><p>Dev timelines are really long- apparently, long enough that they exceed most people&rsquo;s attention spans for stuff that they aren&rsquo;t paying <em>super</em> close attention to. Turn around at a <em>good</em> dev takes so long, years even, that most people will have forgotten the &ldquo;Idea of thing&rdquo; discussion long before &ldquo;Video of thing working&rdquo; comes along and makes them go &ldquo;Oh yeah! I remember that.&rdquo; CIG short circuits this by only ever publishing &ldquo;Idea of thing&rdquo; videos. Since the &ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo; moment never happens, people only casually tuning in never get that pointed reminder that the company last talked about, say, medical gameplay five or whatever years ago. Backers who <em>do</em> remember are invested enough that they will use this as cover to misrepresent the project to themselves and others.</p></li><li><p>Most people are <em>really really bad</em> at critical thinking. This is why like 90% of press releases and politics and public relations actually works. People just accept shit at face value if it is wrapped in enough official language or, better yet, by peers. Think about this forum- if enough goons said this company is the bee&rsquo;s knees and super honest, would you question it initially or would you check it out? If &ldquo;Checking it out&rdquo; involved watching literally years and years and hundreds of hours of <em>super</em> fucking boring theorycraft videos, would you really bother or would you assume that what you were hearing <em>right now</em> was probably valid and in keeping with past statements? If you did that, how long would it take before you started to realize this company was actually totally full of shit? It might be years, depending on how tuned in you were to month-to-month announcements.</p></li></ul><p>This is the fundamental churn that the company relies on, with excited megawhales roping in people who aren&rsquo;t paying attention at a rate equal to or exceeding the rate at which they get wise to the fact that the noises the company is making <em>this</em> year sound exactly like the noises <em>last</em> year and nothing&rsquo;s actually being done.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/IjZnuXw.jpg></figure><p>lmbo at adz becoming a refundian.</p></blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>I am raising money for a civil case against Cig for fraud in the development of star citizen and squadron 42.
