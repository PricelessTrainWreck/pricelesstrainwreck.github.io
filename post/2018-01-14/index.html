Even though they have fairly normalized use in the software development world, there is no governing authority for their use, so you can claim your &ldquo;game&rdquo; is in whatever stage you feel like calling it. So that&rsquo;s one aspect - that calling it &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything.</p><p>But it goes deeper than that. &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; is supposed to denote relative progress, not be a catch-all excuse for anything and everything that is wrong with a project. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in alpha&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t explain why Star Citizen is a complete top-to-bottom piece of complete industry-destroying shit. The lack of quality in Star Citizen is an empirical observation that doesn&rsquo;t stop being true because the game is &ldquo;in alpha.&rdquo;</p><p>Star Citizen is <em>really fucking bad.</em> Even if all of what they&rsquo;re generously calling &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; were miraculously fixed it wouldn&rsquo;t make Star Citizen good, or game, and it would not make Chris Roberts less of a fraud, or CIG less incompetent.

That people are even questioning this amazes me. It&rsquo;s a license, and a license indicates a relationship between two parties, in this case CryTek and CIG. Amazon does not figure into it. CIG jumped ship to Amazon specifically because it was nearly the same engine with a better deal, but I don&rsquo;t think the technicality that some stupid cultists have latched onto (i.e. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same engine so they didn&rsquo;t breach license checkmate goonies&rdquo;) is anything CIG expected to argue, and I still don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll try it. They bet everything that CryTek would dissolve, and they did everything they could to accelerate that event. CIG never intended to honor that contract, like everything else they do.

What he does give out though is enough to redeem that CIG has learned absolutely 0, Nada , Nothing from the disastrous combat experiences following 2.6.</p><p>Notice how Erin, after strolling around the main issue, brings up that the only point he wants to adress in the combat experience is the &ldquo;shooting at pixels&rdquo; bit. That is quote on quote the same shit that Chris ruled down in 2.6 and that ruined the little bit of consistency in Combat design that was left at the end of 2016.</p><p>As i wrote last summer, the Dynamics of Space combat in regards to good gameplay are one of the most complicated and technical topics and require excellent knowledge of both vehicle dynamics and gameplay mechanics as well as game experience. What Erin did is just closing the Circle to 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> Years ago. CIG, as a company, has learned absolutely nothing on the matter. And whatever comes out of the lawsuits, it is absolutely clear that this company does not have the Quality in house that is needed to even design a good combat model and experience, let alone balancing and porting it into an open world MMO enviroment.</p><p>Notice how Erin fills this obvious lack of understanding for the matter with regards to his &ldquo;former Games&rdquo; which are all but meaningless for the matter of Space combat and vehicle dynamics especially in a multiplayer enviroment.</p><p>Again, just like in 2.6 all they can think of regarding vehicle dynamics is speed. that there is literally hundreds of parameters going into the IFCS to create just the basic flight characteristics (let alone the high order combat characteristics) seems to be not only a complete mistery to the one guy who is supposed to make a game out if this, he seems to be completely unaware of them. And this is 4 Years after the initial release of the spaceflight and combat module. Its like time is ticking backwards and the more we progress the less CIG understands about basic gameplay and design. Amazing</p><p>A first step? the team keeps on working on it? this is the same team that couldnt do basic vehicle dynamics&hellip; feck&hellip; high school physics at the end of 2016 and judging by the state of 3.0 and especially this RTV, they have not learned a singe bit.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/G0RF.gif alt="G0RF's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>Not to pile on here, but I think they may want to reconsider their camera positioning and Erin&rsquo;s posture, too.

What remains then are how many of the conditions were breached, and what damages can be awarded for each breach. The most damaging breach would be IP infringement if it is found that SQ42 was sold as a separate title, as it&rsquo;s not covered as such in the GLA. This is the same as Microsoft giving a corp 10 enterprise licenses for Windows Server, then through an audit find that they have 15 copies installed. Each of the 5 excess copies is an infringement that is subject to fees and costs.</p><p>Even if CIG owns a license they decided not to use, it doesn&rsquo;t release them from the other obligations in the GLA. Those being the other causes of action such as providing code changes, displaying the Crytek logo, developing more than one title etc.</p><p>The case will not just hinge on the disputed exclusivity of their use of the engine, nor on whether or not SQ42 is a separate project. It will hinge on the spirit and intent of the GLA. The courts are used to seeing these types of disputes all the time, and when the wording is ambiguous or confusing, the judges always tend to defer to spirit and intent.</p><p><strong>As per the GLA, SQ42 was never agreed to be a separate title. It was defined as being a feature of the &ldquo;GAME&rdquo; (see 1.6 &amp; Exhibit 2).</strong> That&rsquo;s all the court is going to look at. What is in the preamble isn&rsquo;t important, in much the same way that Space Citizen is the name in the preamble, but Star Citizen is what is defined in the definition of &ldquo;GAME&rdquo;.</p><p>After the GLA was signed, modules like Star Marine, Arena Commander, ArcCorp, Hangar were never planned to be separate &ldquo;features&rdquo; or they too would have been listed. They came about as per the increase in scope of the project, and the way they later decided to develop those parts separately and as &ldquo;features&rdquo; of Star Citizen.</p><p>The GLA is going with the spirit and intent of the original campaign which talked about a persistent universe (Star Citizen) and space combat (Squadron 42) features of a single &ldquo;GAME&rdquo; that was pitched. This is what makes SQ42 a feature of that game, just like the others. If they decided to sell Star Marine separately, even though it would launch from the same launcher as Star Citizen, that would be considered a breach of the GLA. They are only allowed to sell a single collective set called the &ldquo;GAME&rdquo; which includes Star Citizen, Squadron 42, and server mods. Neither Squadron 42, nor the server mods, were described as being the primary component like Star Citizen. They are features of the &ldquo;GAME&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>In my opinion, all of Crytek&rsquo;s causes of action have some merit, and for that reason, the motion to dismiss is going to be dismantled by the judge</strong>, and the case going to be set for trial shortly thereafter, if not in the same ruling. <strong>This will give Crytek the ability to start depositions and discovery, as this is a fast track case filing.</strong></p><p>The judge may decide not to give an opinion ruling on the &ldquo;exclusivity&rdquo; issue because there may be issues of intent which can only be revealed and explained during discovery and deposition. I say this because section 2.1.2 isn&rsquo;t as ambiguous (I believe the wording requires that CIG exclusively use CryEngine for the &ldquo;GAME&rdquo;) as people think that it is. And that&rsquo;s why cases go to appeals, and in some cases all the way to the SCOTUS. To me, even 2.1.2 is less important than 2.4 because without the termination (see 8.1, 8.2, 8.3) even if CIG decided to switch engines, it could be said that they breached the GLA by that section alone. Plus they already went on the record admitting that they switched to a competing (there is no argument that any engine other than CryEngine could be considered as a competing engine) game engine, Lumberyard. So even if the judge ruled that CIG were not required to exclusively use CryEngine in the &ldquo;GAME&rdquo;, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can then ignore the other conditions of the GLA - which remains in full force and effect, as per the strict termination conditions.</p><p>Whether the case goes to trial or is settled, depends on the ruling of the motion to dismiss. I don&rsquo;t see how CIG would take this all the way to a jury because any ruling against them for any of the causes of action, can lead to millions of Dollars in damages and attorney fees. <strong>So it would make sense for them to settle if they can. The down side of that is, settling a case from a position of weakness, and against a firm like Skadden, is not the best position to be in.</strong> Plus their liability insurance company is likely to deny their claims if there is finding that they intentionally breached any part of the GLA. And that could make things worse for them in terms of how much they can settle the matter for. Plus, most business liability insurances, have cap limits.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/mmnn.gif alt="Toops's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Computing physics and collisions for other ships and players when the server could just tell you were they are (the server just disagrees with you, anyway, which is why debris jitters so much, or hoverbikes spaz out if you&rsquo;re not the rider).

If CIG wants to comprehensively fail at making a video game, that’s fine, so long as it’s on their own dime. But they compulsively misrepresent their product, and openly lie and misdirect the public as an intentional marketing strategy in order to lure prospective customers. They continually manipulate existing customers with false promises, high-pressure sales techniques, and aggressive retcon with the sole purpose of upselling. I share in your disgust with CIG’s predatory marketing and sales tactics. We all do.</p><p>But you have shown the courage, intelligence, and determination to put your ethics into action as a means to promote positive change, and that makes you a great person. Your story is inspiring, and nobody can take that from you.</p><p>One thing I’ve learned about shitizens: The ugliness of their response is directly proportional to the perceived threat you pose to their delusion. You know you have a physical disability. But the fact that they would stoop so low as to exploit that as a rhetorical technique is a perfect expression of their intellectual impotence and the deep subconscious anxiety that subsumes their brittle belief system. It’s an indefensible indictment against their character. It can’t feel good, but whatever the outcome of your lawsuit, you’ve already won. Their flailing insults, their ignorant rants, are but roses thrown from the cheap seats during your victory lap.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Toops**</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Not-So-Secret Santa Streetroller Giveaway</p><p>PO Box &ldquo;That Star Citizen Thread&rdquo;</p><p>Beverly Hills, CA</p><p>90210</p><p>Dear Streetroller,</p><p>The terrible people commenting on your video are some sad, hurt people.
