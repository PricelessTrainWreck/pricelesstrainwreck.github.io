Of course if I was wrong it would have been a blue on blue incident to rival that of Leonard Skinly, but that&rsquo;s just more lols for the thread. Anyway here&rsquo;s what I got back (I have no idea why Hogarth mentioned rules-breaking, since I specifically told him that the poster was abiding by the rules):</p><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/859015.png></figure></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Scruffpuff.jpg alt="Scruffpuff's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>The one glaring thing from all of these attempts at gameplay is this: <strong>even if the game worked flawlessly, it would suck beyond description.</strong> I never hear the streamers, for all their protestations of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Alpha!&rdquo;, address this in any way. No amount of fidelity, no amount of bugfixing, and no amount of polish can hide it: there is no game here. It is a joyless romp through generic nothingness - go to this point, aim at a box, and push a button. Congratulations CIG, the best-case scenario of a 100% functioning game still can&rsquo;t save it from the dumpster - where it can sit next to Sandi&rsquo;s excised film debut.</p><p>Sorry Chris, I know while you were pretending to be a director you heard this phrase a lot, but it can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t apply to your game: some things just can&rsquo;t get &ldquo;fixed in post.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Scruffpuff.jpg alt="Scruffpuff's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>His rant at the end gloriously missed the point as well. He&rsquo;s obviously upset at the whole thing, and he&rsquo;s ranting at CIG about how the quality of Live is lower than the PTU etc. Just ranting and raving and not having any of the &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just an Alpha&rdquo; excuses slow him down. While I enjoy the salt, I&rsquo;m still blown away - absolutely mind blown - how much he&rsquo;s missing the point. And it&rsquo;s not just him - every streamer, every backer, missing the procedurally-generated forest for the high-fidelity trees.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that CIG released the game in this state to the Live environment. The frame-rate doesn&rsquo;t matter. The patch cycle doesn&rsquo;t matter. This guy needs to get something through his head - he can&rsquo;t treat CIG like a game development company because <em>CIG is not a game development company.</em> <strong>They are a company creating digital assets for sale, and they&rsquo;re attempting to cobble together an online world in which to use those assets. The company is led by a non-game developer who <em>is not qualified, and in fact uniquely unqualified</em> to do his job, and the company has produced nothing</strong>, has no history, and no path forward. Holding them to the standards of a game development company is unbelievably stupid.</p><p>That&rsquo;s one part of it.</p><p>The next part is the assumption that CIG gives a flying fuck about what they release to the PTU or whatnot as if it&rsquo;s all part of normal game testing and deployment. It isn&rsquo;t. Every single byte of code that lands on the PTU, or anywhere else, is done for purely optic reasons - not to do anything for backers or the people who have funded this. It&rsquo;s to create gaming journal headlines like &ldquo;Long-Awaited 3.0 Patch Goes Live&rdquo; just in time for backers to spend their Christmas money on Chris&rsquo;s lies again. It&rsquo;s so they can create a false narrative of progress (like how 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, now 3.0, are all numbers going up hence progress and not a scam at all guys). So when this guy rants and raves about the relative quality of what&rsquo;s released to &ldquo;Test&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Live&rdquo; my stomach actually hurts as I realize how naive he is - going into this with the belief that the &ldquo;Test&rdquo; and &ldquo;Live&rdquo; environments are being used as if Chris understands them, how they&rsquo;re used, why they&rsquo;re used, etc. It literally hurts to listen to.</p><p>Dear Streamer: if you haven&rsquo;t already, please take a few hours out of your life and <strong>go watch The Truman Show. Then come to the realization that Chris Roberts is doing the exact same thing with Star Citizen.</strong> That&rsquo;s why there are so many videos which they are peddling as &ldquo;open development.&rdquo; It explains why the highest possible fidelity assets were built before the engine was done. It explains why they don&rsquo;t patch properly or test properly. Or do anything properly. I realize the awakening to the fact that Star Citizen has devolved into a scam is a painful one, but that pain is worth it. Once you get past it, instead of banging your head against the wall trying to understand this project, you will actually be able to predict its course.</p><p>Example: soon there will be a concept ship sale. No matter the state of the game at the time, no matter the bug count, no matter the lawsuit status - there will be a ship sale. <strong>Anything and everything CIG can do to move dollars from your bank account to theirs is their #1 priority all day and all night, 365 days of the year.</strong> Stop throwing yourself against this brick wall - there&rsquo;s nothing on the other side.</p></blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/avatars/twitter.png alt="twitter emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>in a few years I bet any StarTrek episode could more or less be re-played live in Star Citizen :P</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>In about three years we&rsquo;ll either be able to convincingly recreate pretty much any episode of Star Trek or be able to take off from our 2013 hangars.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a coin flip at this point really.</p></blockquote><p>We can already do at least one!</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gjMoehH.jpg alt=https://i.imgur.com/gjMoehH.jpg></figure><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>What could sour the perception of this project for the remaining cultists?

There’s no word in the english language to describe their perfect blend of stupidity and delusion. Over the years, the process of Star Citizen has bled out all rational thought, all meaningful discourse, and like the slow meticulous pruning and root binding of the bonsai, so has Star Citizen painstakingly cultivated a perfectly impotent caricature of an adult human with free will.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Chris could make Derek the new ship design director today and the backers would start rationalising it tomorrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Derek was never really against star citizen, he was just an outside observer offering valuable critical feedback&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Derek is an industry veteran who knows everything about designing giant buggy spaceships, he&rsquo;ll be a great addition to the team&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I actually LIKE Derek&rsquo;s balls!&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Finishing anything at all would probably do it. Remember the golf swing scanning incident? The backers think they were upset because a golf swing mechanic is bad and dumb but I&rsquo;m <em>pretty sure</em> they were actually upset because it was a mechanic at all. It came dangerously close to pinning some design detail down and that cut off whole avenues of theory crafting. Suddenly Star Citizen was supposed to be a video game again rather than the cyber-rapture for hyper-suckers which they paid for.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/VirtualCaptain.jpg alt="Virtual Captain's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>I think the tracker and perhaps even my posting have subconsciously been led by some desire to highlight how bad the foundation and current state of the game is. Thinking that at some point backers would start demanding real progress. Yesterday I saw a thread titled &ldquo;Frame rate a “major” focus for 3.1! Check latest ATV.&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s when it hit me. The thing could crash instantly for the entire playerbase and they&rsquo;d be absolutely fine as long as their belief session shows still air. Some people ITT tried to play last week and of the three people that got past the loadscreen, I think one managed to get in their ship, so by my count this has basically already happened. Many backers fully admit they do not install new patches, as they prefer dream crafting with their favorite streamer over playing what actual gets delivered. I finally got it, these people are absolutely in a belief cult.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>I posted about this upthread, but something that unmistakeably without a shadow of a doubt destroys their faith in <em>Chris Roberts personally</em>.

CIG&rsquo;s accounts could certainly do it if they reveal shocking extravagance. Turning up drunk or high to the Whale dinner and stammering out what he really thinks of them. <em>Maybe</em> a revelation in Sunk Cost Galaxy if it&rsquo;s big enough and embarrassing enough and easy enough to understand.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s gotta be personal and it&rsquo;s gotta be aimed directly at the backers, and it&rsquo;s gotta be from Chris himself.

Evidence that Sandi has spent millions on funding personal film projects wouldn&rsquo;t do it (too remote from the backers).
