McKinney says the fix will come by 3.1, yet in the wrap-up Lando — sensing the obvious, terrifying threat of unambiguous commitments to fix that which formerly worked via the next patch — helpfully corrects him, saying “You said it will definitely be in by 3.1 — I do wanna say ‘It is definitely our <em>intention</em> to have it in by 3.1.”</p><p>Lando knows the drill by now and negotiated their escape route in advance on the good chance that the re-fix for a much-needed feature which formerly worked doesn’t make it back in at the next fixed deadline.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIJtzjUsf08&amp;t=3m59s">2 - “How will the mechanics for multiple character slots work?”</a> - In a surprise twist, Lando dons his developer cap to answer this one himself. And the answer is basically classic Lando, invoking the challenges of <del><em>ad hoc</em></del>, er sorry, <em>Active</em> Game Development as precursor to a long punt of the feature into 2019 or beyond territory… **&lsquo;no plans to implement multiple character slots in 2018&rsquo;</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIJtzjUsf08&amp;t=5m38s">3 - “Are Scanning Mechanics, beyond salvage, in the works?“</a>** - Lando further clarifies that this is a <em>“When?”</em> question, which Foundry UK dev Will Maiden deftly redirects via verbal judo, “When questions to the left please…”</p><p><strong>FLASHBACK!</strong></p><p>Now, let’s take a moment to revisit one of my favorite videos of the CIG catalog, <em>The Road to CitizenCon</em>, for a year and a half ago, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=6m37s">wonderfully telling exchange took place</a> between Chris Roberts and Foundry’s Director of Cinematics Hannes Appell. Ironically, the viz guy was apparently proposing to the <em>Game Director</em> that they include some approximation of a Scanning system in their Sandworm demo. The demo was ostensibly about giving players a feeling for the wonders of 3.0 (<img src=/img/emotes/lol.gif alt="lol emote" class=sa-emote>). How perfectly typical that Chris — who was fixated at the time on nailing the realism of the fictive sandworm’s wriggling animations — comes across as disinterested in worrying too much about how they’ll depict an actual new mechanic needed for 3.x.</p><p>Here we are, a year and a half later and Scanning is finally on the design table. Chris Roberts could barely be bothered with Game Design for 3.0 back when they were supposedly hard at work on it. He just really wanted to wriggle his big fictive worm as fidelitiously as possible in the dazzle reel for 3.0. What a Visionary.</p><p><strong>END FLASHBACK</strong></p><p>Punchline to Maiden’s update, <strong>“I can’t really say when (Scanning)’s getting through but that’s where our heads are at at the moment for both Scanning and Mining.”</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIJtzjUsf08&amp;t=9m43s">4) “Any news at all about the Banu Merchantman?”</a> - <a href="https://youtu.be/BIJtzjUsf08?t=587">&lsquo;Uhh bad news guys its not being worked on at all atm. We need more RESOURCES&rsquo;</a></p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIJtzjUsf08&amp;t=12m28s">5) “Why do I have to go to Reddit, Twitter, etc. to find official answers that should’ve been posted on Spectrum?”</a> Good question. Answer is “adaptive something something”. This answer is the longest one provided during this show, and not from a Dev but a Community Manager.</p><p>this leaves CIG 4 for 4 on non-commital replies with respect to release targets for features or ships the actual Devs were asked about.</p><p>“Keep doing what you’re doing, CIG!”</p><p><img src=/img/emotes/sandance.gif alt="sandance emote" class=sa-emote></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/G0RF.gif alt="G0RF's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>Eric’s Burndown duties represented the final step of what we’ve been now told is The Old Way of things, right? We were told by CIG directly that they were switching to quarterly releases because they didn’t want a repeat of the entire 3.0 cycle of misery. Burndown was a late chapter in that process, and somebody needed to do it.</p><p>Watching Ask The Devs is very different. Davis was explaining why something expected in late 2016 still wasn’t released. But Devs on <em>Ask The Devs</em> have the freedom to say (as Will Maiden did just this morning) “‘When?’ questions to the left please!”</p><p>Lando explained it further by saying that those who can answer the What? questions frequently aren’t those who can answer the When? questions. (In this case, Papy is probably the authority.)</p><p>This is very different than what Davis had to do because the When and What both had been declared in advance by Chris and proved painfully inaccurate. Devs weren’t given a chance to counter those claims yet surely none believed full Stanton by December 2016 was realistic.</p><p>I made note in my <a href=http://i.imgur.com//XA1CtWp.png>9 Voices</a> infographic of just how critical the Past and Future end up being in Star Citizen debates, and the distinction between what Davis was doing and what Maiden did today is a temporal one. Davis was explaining remaining impediments to hit a Past target long missed. Maiden (or Papy, or whoever) have the freedom to say “we don’t have a date yet”. Surely you see the distinction?</p><p>Of the first 4 answers given on today’s “Ask a Dev”, we saw that freedom liberally exercised:</p><p>1 - Chad McKinney said they <em>hoped</em> to have Ship Persistence on logout back in by 3.1 but Lando reminded people it was their <em>intention</em> not a commitment to deliver.</p><p>2 - Lando said Multiple Character slots were not a 2018 target.</p><p>3 - Will Maiden talked plans for Scanning mechanics yet expressly declined to talk When.</p><p>4 - Kirk Tome said he didn’t have any dates to give on the Merchantman.</p><p>If it’s not clear, I consider this a positive.</p><p>I know there is this <strong>overwhelming fantasy amongst many critics that publishers are a necessary requirement for games to stay on course and on budget</strong> - but they&rsquo;re also the greatest failing to advancement of gaming by only focusing on profit and marketability over all else.</p><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>Publishers have cost the gaming community many potentially great games because instead of making all the money they&rsquo;d only make some of the money. We have a bunch of gamers willing to put their money where their mouth is and essentially give someone a chance to build the game they and we want.</p></blockquote><p>Well now you’re getting a little surly, Cymelion, and I’m not sure why. I’m not many critics and I’m not subscribing to false dichotomies.</p><p>I reject absolutist claims about Publishers Pro or Con. As horrifying as it might sound to admit, some of the greatest games I’ve ever played have actually been put out through the traditional Publisher / Developer model. What say we of all the wonderful titles of the last 3 decades? That they were all compromised by the corruptions of the process? Of course not.</p><p>Inversely, what day we off all the Crowdfunding failures? The recent SystemShock setbacks? The myriad disappointments of <a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/mobile/reviews.cfm?read=453&amp;game=935&amp;ismb=1">SOTA?</a> The absence of a Publisher didn’t guarantee them anything and may have cost them some decent counsel. In SystemShock’s case, a Publisher might’ve said “stick to the plan you pitched and stop trying to reinvent what you originally intended to just <a href=https://kotaku.com/kickstarted-system-shock-remaster-got-too-big-put-on-h-1823082070>remaster.”</a></p><p>Crowdfunding is such a recent disruption to the old model that anyone who has played games as long as I have (since loading them of cassette tape on a TI-99/4a) has countless memories of <em>perfect, wonderful gaming experiences produced by the traditional model.</em></p><p>In some cases, Developers released masterpieces and even credited Publishers for their patience, largesse or for believing enough in their scrappy little title to push it to massive retail distribution making both parties successful.</p><p>Are EA and Activision greedy? Hell yes. Has their greed screwed up things? Absolutely. It kills me just badly they botched _Battlefront 2_— and maybe you as well. That’s a perfect example of Publisher interventions pissing away a dozen incredible advantages — the talent of DICE, the power of Frostbite, the Star Wars franchise itself, the Battlefront legacy — Publisher greed made a damning botch of what should’ve been a home run for all of us who love Space Games and a pox on them for that</p><p>So here we are. <strong>Publishers can be great or terrible. Crowdfunding can be liberating or lackluster.</strong> But broadsides about either are easily falsifiable and no more appropriate for conversation than hatchets are for surgery. They’re crude, blunt tools where precision instruments are required; required because we need sharp points and clean cuts to make good work of the job. And the job here is not choosing between a false dichotomy of Publishers vs Crowdfunding, the job in this subreddit and discussion is very specifically about the good and bad of Star Citizen’s Development history. I think despite being a Goon I have a pretty good handle on both and even in my comments in this discussion and other reddit and SA ones I’m not stingy with praise of the good.</p><p>On that matter, I assume you know my position of things but if it isn’t clear by now I’d like to be explicit. I’m not one throwing hatchets as CIG wholesale and hoping to cause as much damage as I can. I’m no troll and no hater. Ask any Goon and they‘ll tell you I don’t root for the failure of Star Citizen, I’ve always been more than happy to praise developers and have written many a kind thing about specific employees over the years because <em>the good works deserve praise even at our dead comedy forums just as surely as bad deeds (dishonest marketing, overpromising / underdelivering, Orwellian moderation, etc) deserve condemnation here.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong><h2>CIG fails to answer how they plan to mesh servers</h2></strong></p><p><a href=https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/50259/thread/what-will-be-the-extent-of-the-first-pass-on-the-s/968182>Clive Johnson CIG</a></p><blockquote><p>For the first-pass version we&rsquo;ll probably divide the Stanton system into sections and have one server manage each section. So we might have a Port Olisar server, another for Yela, and so on. Migration between servers would only happen as players QT from one location to another (although if you had the patience to do so you would also be able to fly between servers at sub-quantum speeds). We won&rsquo;t be connecting game servers across server regions (US, EU, etc) in this version. It also seems likely that each server region will still have multiple instances of the Stanton system.</p><p>Obviously this is a much simplified implementation compared to what we eventually want to achieve but it is still complex enough that we will need to deliver several key pieces of the technology. First among these is the ability to connect multiple game servers in the same simulation. Next, seamlessly transitioning entities and clients between servers. We&rsquo;ll also need changes to our backend services to keep track of which players are on which server and determine when they need to transition to another. The services may also have to handle spinning up and shutting down new game servers on demand, as we&rsquo;d like to avoid running a server for a section (e.g. Daymar) unless some players are actually there. Finally, game code will most likely have to undergo some changes to ensure that things like missions and the economy continue to function correctly even though the entities involved may be spread among multiple servers.</p><p>Once the initial version has been put through its paces we will continue to improve and refine the technology with future pre-alpha releases, incrementally bringing us closer to the final goal of a single shard universe.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><img src=/img/emotes/lol.gif alt="lol emote" class=sa-emote> at them admitting that they have to rewrite (again) most of their backend code to enable even the most basic form of inter-server connections.

They finally realized they can’t do what they promised, due to how they designed the game, as well as the features they have been touting, while hobbled with a sub-par engine and a woefully inexperienced dev team who have never built anything like this</strong></p><p><strong>So basically, that’s the end of 1000 player instances. Assuming they can solve the performance issues in the game and the networking – which they can’t</strong> – they would be lucky to have even 16 clients in an instance. And if they stick around long enough to even manage connecting instances to each other, ask yourself this: How on this God’s Earth are they going to handle restrictions on the massive ships in the game and keeping them from transitioning instances? Imagine two capital ships in instance A, now connecting those players to instance B which also has even more of those. And here you thought they were ever going to solve performance issues. Good luck with the grouping. LOL!!</p><p>They keep making promises in order to keep kicking the can down the road in order to get the gullible backers giving them money. The “game”, how ever it turns out <strong>by the time the whole thing collapses, will never – ever – be the MMO+ they promised. Not only have they just confirmed it, but they’ve basically also now confirmed that it’s going to remain a session based instanced game, which hopefully they will figure out how to connect instances to each other. Hopefully.</strong></p><p>It’s hilarious when I think about it because back when we were designing Line Of Defense, I knew this was going to be a problem. That’s why we designed the network (Wide Span Global) the way that we did, while partitioning the game world with controls that allow us to restrict the number of clients in a scene. <strong>This is the sort of thing you build from the ground up – and right from the start. You just can’t tack that on at any time.</strong> Most especially when using an engine like CryEngine and it’s derivative Lumberyard – neither of which were designed for MMOs (those who tried, found out the hard way).</p><p>They have yet to build a SINGLE star system. They’re still screwing around with a couple moons in Stanton.</p><p>The Crytek lawsuit has revealed a lot of previously unknown things about this project – and there’s a LOT more to come from what I have learned. For one thing, we learned that Crytek – not CIG/F42 – built all the tech demos that they were passing off as the “game prototype”. So, if you saw <a href=https://vimeo.com/53745615>this Kickstarter update of Nov 18, 2012</a>, and you were wondering why it looks and plays so differently, it’s because it was – again – created by Crytek as a proof-of-concept tech demo used to inspire confidence and to sell the “game” to backers. Chris and his crew passed it off as the game prototype.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Beer4theBeerGod</div><blockquote><p>They&rsquo;re avoiding admitting it because what they&rsquo;re implementing is <em>the exact same fucking thing they said they would do back in 2012</em>. The original scope was instance-based with scenes roughly the size of an Arena Commander match. You go into, have a dynamically generated encounter designed to be more narrative and immersive than the relatively sterile approach from Elite, and then when the instance was emptied the resulting information would be applied to the primary database to generate more encounters.</p><p>Unfortunately Chris never fleshed things out sufficiently because he&rsquo;s an incompetent hack with a toddler-grade attention span and most of the competent developers who were around when this concept was viable left to make actual games for actual game companies.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many posts I&rsquo;ve made or seen guys like Beer make on reddit going &ldquo;Dude, you guys <em>know</em> they&rsquo;re just gonna end up doing instances, right?&rdquo; only to get literally bowled over with people actually furious that you&rsquo;d dare impugn Chris Roberts&rsquo;s honor.</p><p>CR and his crew sold Star Citizen as revolutionary, as a universe that&rsquo;s the next best thing to whatever they call that dumb bullshit in Ready Player One.

Except <em>maybe</em> 3D assets; but even in that case, they seem to have gone with a very <a href="https://youtu.be/4-xa9j7xvws?t=1261">manual process</a> that doesn&rsquo;t scale at all. Artists spend literally years perfecting the appearance, damage states, animations, etc. In the recent AtV this artist talks about manually placing all the different wires and spark effects that you&rsquo;ll see when a section blows off. Uhhh What!? If you have a hundred ships left to do wouldn&rsquo;t it be wiser to make a handful of &lsquo;critical damage here&rsquo; effects and apply them as needed? Imagine painting blood on every possible damage location for a counter strike character. It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense right? Same principle, just apply the decal anywhere damage impacts. Does Chris think that wouldn&rsquo;t be detailed enough? Perhaps that is difficult to impossible with the vehicle model in CryEngine? I don&rsquo;t know the answer.</p><p>Ok let&rsquo;s pretend you wanna spend another four years pixel perfecting every ship because your boss is an incredible sperg who <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/5bh9rx/star_citizens_scope_schedule_and_funding_are/>thinks there is no limit on scope, scale, or funding</a>. The other scalability problem becomes apparent, once you get a couple of these 100,000 poly ships on screen, the <a href=https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/star-citizen-alpha-3-0-performance-tidbits>client and/or server</a> start shitting themselves. You just destroyed the possibility of massive player battles everyone is expecting by putting more emphasis on the art than the gameplay design.

But admitting that would cause the whole house of cards to collapse, so they&rsquo;re cultivating this weird notion that they&rsquo;re sitting on in-progress revolutionary technology, when in fact they&rsquo;re sitting on a pile of hacks and kludges, that will either have to be thrown away or infect anything put on top. This is becoming increasingly obvious even to non-tech savvy outsiders, leading to backers <strong>becoming increasingly isolated in a greater gaming community that once had a fairly positive outlook on the future of this project, but now, at best consider it an unremarkable P2W game in the making, and at worst a downright scam.</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Scruffpuff.jpg alt="Scruffpuff's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><blockquote><p>In you go, thinking you have a handle on some part of the project, right?
