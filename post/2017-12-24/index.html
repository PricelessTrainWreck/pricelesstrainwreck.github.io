Mocap should be a tool for animators. It can be really difficult to get some motions right without mocap. I remember an episode from a game I worked on where the animators needed mocap of dumping a body in a dumpsters (not the the easiest thing to manually animate so it looks right). Problem was that humans are actually pretty heavy, so most people can&rsquo;t really do this without having it look silly. So a really big guy and a really small woman did the mocap, and animators did their magic to make it fit the body sizes in-game.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a monumental waste of money to drag any kind of highly paid actor, especially an A-lister, through mocap for a game.
