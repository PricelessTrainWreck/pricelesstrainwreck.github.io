People streaming and/or &ldquo;playing&rdquo; it has all but dried up. This new plan is exactly what you&rsquo;re all saying it is - taking away the visible evidence, and cherry-picking fully deluded backers - those who have sustained such extensive brain and neurological damage that they would <em>pay the man they gave free money to for the privilege of face time</em>. Those people are going to swallow whatever CGI dick Chris hands them - right down to the balls. Then they&rsquo;ll go out into the world and spread their cognitive plague to the ignorant, telling tales of incredible gameplay, stunning AI, and swearing on their mothers&rsquo; graves that The Dream Is Real.</p><p><strong>When in doubt, recruit more fanatics.

It will become a sort of intellectual leprosy - people with functioning minds will go to great pains to avoid those who talk about how great it was/is/will be.</p><p>Sort of like now, come to think of it.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>G0RF</div><blockquote><p><strong>ON THE NORMALIZATION OF DEVELOPMENTAL DYSFUNCTION</strong></p><p>The hardest thing for true believers to accept, particularly after interacting with developers and artists on a tour, is based on a false dichotomy framing.</p><p>“All these people can’t be lying to me. They are nice, sincere, talented and working like dogs for this dream therefore it really is real.”</p><p>The frame is wrong. A visit, particularly to the HQ of CIG Mythmaking (CIG LA), amounts to a guided tour of the acute developmental dysfunction “normalized” under Chris Roberts practiced, Code Whispering hands.</p><p>The appearance of “Bad Sean” on the Newegg livestream shows exactly what this looks like, as Sean is asked “what is Star Citizen?” and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qblLBI33Uvw&amp;t=46m16s">gives the Chris Roberts answer.</a></p><p>Do we see willful calculation and nefarious intent at work here? No, we see a developer who spends the majority of his working hours in close proximity to the Reality Distortion Field that is Chris Roberts. This is how Chris talks about the game despite the fact that it does <em>not</em> have hundreds of Star Systems, it has 1/4th of only 1. Yet if Sean Tracy had gone on that stream and said “Star Citizen has a few moons and a planetoid in it right now” Chris would’ve surely said “what the hell are you doing telling people that?!”</p><p>The beauty of “The Road to CitizenCon” is that it meant to glorify their struggles and excuse their failures yet what it <em>really</em> did was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=0m32s">capture Chris’s pathology so incriminatingly.</a></p><p>Josh Herman states it plainly: “Chris has very high expectations and I think a lot of us do, and we all want to match them.”</p><p>Indeed, no one can doubt Chris can be a cruel taskmaster. But his “very high expectations” are more truly described as “very dysfunctional expectations” and the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=6m37s">gives testament to exactly that.</a></p><p>Chris is more pre-occupied with the gesticulations of an imaginary worm than nearly anything else in the Homestead demo, a point only further driven home in the Jump Point transcripts which offer yet more glimpses as conductor leads orchestra in rehearsals for the wrong song. Throughout the video, we get pull quotes from developers worldwide, all laboring to hit that which the boss has deemed the target. And hit it they mostly did, save for some minor glitches, and the video spends ample time <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=15m00s">basking in the afterglow of the wrong job well done.</a> Yet to what end, really, beyond fundraising jolts and <a href=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-10-10-star-citizen-impresses-at-citizencon-with-big-new-procedural-planets-video>breathless coverage of credulous press?</a></p><blockquote><p>Specifically it shows off Star Citizen&rsquo;s procedural planet-making abilities which, yes I know that&rsquo;s a sensitive subject, but look at the results here. Those vistas are gobsmacking. Trees! Deserts! Other living things! And those sky-boxes? They&rsquo;re not - that&rsquo;s the game world. Whatever the unrestricted view distance touches, you should be able to get to.</p><p>The mission demonstrated is apparently indicative of the kind of planetary missions we&rsquo;ll be carrying out in Star Citizen, the game&rsquo;s leader, Chris Roberts, said. They&rsquo;ll be handcrafted missions supplemented with &ldquo;algorithmic&rdquo; content. The demo also shows us a stealth takedown.</p></blockquote><p>_(Eurogamer then went on to outline all the features of 3.0 that would be arriving by the end of 2016, and we recall all too well how <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/6o40ga/star_citizen_development_progress_infographic/>that turned out</a> as CIG endured the painful work of downsizing formerly sold fictive expectations so they could deliver the practical compromise a year after the fact.)_</p><p>Returning to “The Road to CitizenCon”, It’s incredible, really, the surreal victory lap everyone takes for having won the wrong race. The coercions to normalize all of it, every misguided week spent in its construction, are everywhere even as we and CIG all know now what a high price was paid for it.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=15m52s">“The game will come out when the game comes out.”</a></p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=16m2s">”I definitely backed the right game.”</a></p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=16m47s">A special guest appearance by The Boss’s Wife, who is unseen during crunch and had nothing to do with the demo prep yet wasn’t too busy to stop by and emote so she’d get her share of the glory due her lessers.</a></p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=17m6s">A tagteam performance from Lando and Ben, both making explicit entreaties for viewers to interpret the dysfunction on grand display as not just normal but ideal.</a></p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=18m12s">Brian Chambers describing the event as emotional and saying, “We came to show off our progress, and I think that’s what we did.”</a></p><p><strong>And the capper, as we <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsF6_lwLas&amp;t=18m25s">hear in plain terms <em>why</em> the demo was such a smashing success.</a> <em>They made the Boss proud. Mission accomplished.</em></strong></p><p>How, after seeing all the blood, sweat and tears, could anyone doubt the hard working, friendly people who endured a summertime crunch to create that emotional moment? <em>The developers themselves believe this is normal because their Boss has deemed it so and it was the necessary business to please him.</em></p><p>It is against this entire backdrop of collective effort that we can really appreciate the contrast offered by the stoic, cautious Todd Papy. As teams worldwide were laboring furiously to realize Chris’s grand fictive ambitions, it is Papy who anticipates the confusion risk and states point blank, “I just don’t want to be selling something we might not have in the game.”</p><p>Imagine that entirely reasonable soundbite edited in to The Road to CitizenCon, as teams were constructing the sandworm demo.</p><p>It’s impossible, right? That an entirely reasonable, morally cautious statement like that would never belong in such a video is because it would stand like a sharp pin above the fragile bubble of dysfunctional fiction that the entire video inflates over the course of 20 minutes.</p><p>Papy isn’t the only one expressing caution and sobriety, however much it runs counter to CIG’s aspirational semi-fictions. We saw a similar sobriety on “Calling All Devs” from Luke Pressley as he openly admitted Cargo Missions weren’t fun. You’d never have guessed that by watching <a href=https://youtu.be/q5rXhAJcSeQ>The Alpha 3.0 Feature Trailer</a> as the Cargo Box is the top-billed star and what a delightful adventure it enjoys (that has little to do with the actually quite mundane business of Cargo Transport in the game…)</p><p>But we can be sure that anyone visiting CIG LA for a glimpse of hidden wizardry isn’t getting a tour guide pointing out sorting fictions from facts, the short term likelihoods from the long term hopes. This is true for MoMA and will surely be true of the $350 guests in May. Any secret demos shown will all one big glowing ball of the transcendent glorious gaming that’s finally, <em>finally</em> right around the corner. It’s coming to validate the indeterminable wait and unbelievable expense. It will make all the past lies okay. It will humble all who dared doubt the process. And it will stand as open rebuke to the AAA industry itself; they didn’t believe in Chris’s vision and now must endure humiliation by it.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Beer4theBeerGod</div><blockquote><p>Star Citizen stopped being a crowdfunded project and turned into an alternative reality game around the time that Derek showed up. <strong>Chris was right about one thing; after about three years things begin to get stale.</strong> Star Citizen started to get stale around 2015, and now as we near the three year mark of Derek&rsquo;s involvement the same is true for the ARG.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Virtual Captain</div><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/m7fjUVq.png></figure></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-03-12/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="March Set 4">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-03-20/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="March Set 7">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
