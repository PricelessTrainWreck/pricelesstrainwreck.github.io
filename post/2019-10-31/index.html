This is the supply/demand chart for all materials currently tradeable in game. See, every &ldquo;Tick&rdquo; of server time, which I think is like 5 minutes, every base in the game will increase its supply and/or demand for a resource by the amount specified here, up to some predetermined cap.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/C4bmBcJ.jpg alt=https://i.imgur.com/C4bmBcJ.jpg></figure><p>Now what you might notice at first is that most things have <em>way</em> more demand than supply! That&rsquo;s very good, right?</p><p>Well, no, for several reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Most of the items with huge demand have profit margins in the fraction-of-a-percent range. Beryl, for example, can be purchased for 4.18 and sold for 4.28 per unit, for a total profit of &ldquo;Fucking nothing&rdquo; per run. A multi-million-credit trade ship fully loaded with this stuff is going to make about 5k credits per half-hour or longer run. Not even enough to cover refueling.</p></li><li><p>Most of the demand/supply is split across stations with hugely different locations. It could take 40+ minutes to unload one load from one station, again for no profit.</p></li><li><p>Any station that isn&rsquo;t one of the big city ports is pointless for these, because you can&rsquo;t land ships big enough to make it worthwhile at the tiniest bases. You can land off-base, of course, but then you run the risk of not being able to sell, or having your ship despawned for &ldquo;illegal parking.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Basically everything you see with low supply/high demand is the kind of hugely unprofitable vendor-trash that you can only haul around once you&rsquo;ve got a bulk megafreighter that can handle enormous quantities at once.</p></li></ul><p>Well, you ask, what about the stuff that has a huge profit margin? The drugs and shit?</p><p>Look at the very bottom of the chart.</p><p>See those razor-thin lines, Neon, E-Tam, Widow, Altruciatoxin? The ones that produce <em>twenty</em> SCU per tick and are consumed at exactly one station, on the opposite side of the system? Yeah. That&rsquo;s what became of the high-profit goods. Keep in mind these numbers are for the <em>entire server.</em> One Constellation with 96 SCU can monopolize the <em>entire</em> drug trade for all of the drug-selling stations, simultaneously.</p><p>So this is what trading is now- you need to <em>already own</em> the biggest trade ship in the game. Then you buy the entire stock of vendor trash from one of the places, and fly it to either Area 18 or Lorville, the only two areas in the game that buy stuff in any kind of bulk. You need to go through the landing sequence, ride the elevators, ride the trains, go to the customs shop, and <em>then</em> sell it- a trip that may take an hour total, for a payout equivalent to less than one combat mission.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Sarsapariller</div><blockquote><p>It feels like a system designed by three or four generations of interns reacting to and iterating on the previous generation&rsquo;s work with a general idea of what a space game&rsquo;s trading <em>should</em> be, but without any understanding of how to make it work.</p><p>Gen 1: Well space games have lots of trade commodities so let&rsquo;s throw a bunch in there. Also drugs, which will have a high price point but be illegal to sell. We&rsquo;ll work out the legal system later!</p><p>Gen 2: Supply and demand is a thing in space games so let&rsquo;s limit how much you can buy/sell, and I&rsquo;ll just tie it to the local server time for convenience sake. Legal system? Someone else can worry about that.</p><p>Gen 3: Well it&rsquo;s too easy to buy a million drugs and people are actually earning space ships, so we&rsquo;ll just tweak these numbers <em>down</em> and these numbers <em>up</em> and there you go, problem solved. Why are you bothering me about tick rates and legal systems?</p><p>Gen 4: Look I don&rsquo;t know why the supply and demand numbers are so fucked up, or why illegal drugs aren&rsquo;t actually illegal, or why you have to sit at a console for five minutes before they&rsquo;ll buy your shit! All I know is, Chris said he wants to add more travel time, so I&rsquo;m going to move all the pick up points to <em>one</em> side of the system, and the sales points to the <em>other</em> side.

Our journey started with the sale of JPGs representing gameplay features that we wouldn&rsquo;t deliver on, each carefully crafted by skilled hands in our JPG factory and what would later become the core of our funding model. From the very first moment, we wanted to make an insanely complex and realistic simulation of a cave exploration system within a multiplayer sandbox environment. The goal was huge and ambitious and the course was set.</p><p>With a full team, it took us less than two years (because development only really started 2 years ago) to make our vision into a reality. Star Citizen was launched in Early Access Beta in February 2027. We succeeded in releasing a game that was almost impossible to be made, often having to cross and bend the boundaries of our game engine – Unreal, which as you know, we switched to after realizing that CryEngine wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to give us the fidelity we desired. The start was a little bumpy but soon enough players recognized that our game was providing a unique experience that could not be found in any other game. The support of our players has confirmed that Star Citizen is truly special and we are very proud of it.</p><p>We are also proud of you – our whales. We couldn’t have even dreamed of creating such a dedicated and engaging community as ours is – both on Epic Store and on Spectrum. We are grateful for all the support you gave us during these decades and for all wonderful adventures we went through while trying to survive Star Citizen’s gaze. This expedition left a mark on us for life. Together we built the world of Star Citizen.</p><p>Unfortunately, the cruel reality is – not enough players were brought into our world of Star Citizen to make it commercially viable, even after we sold 50% of the company to Epic. After the sloppy start of the game, predominately in terms of bugs and issues, we gave our best to fix the game and add new content via numerous patches and updates. Star Citizen grew, got better, but is still far from the original idea of what Star Citizen was meant to be. Factions, additional ships, trade posts, all of this was simply put aside since our team was constantly fighting technical issues, some of which were simply impossible to be solved for good.</p><p>That struggle is coming to an end. At this point, without an influx of new players, the game doesn’t pay for its development. That’s why we had to make some hard decisions…</p><p>CIG can’t afford for further development of Star Citizen. There will be no new updates, bugfixes or any official changes to the game.</p><p>However, since the game is playable and we believe it offers a unique gameplay experience, we want to keep it going for players who want to enjoy it.</p><p>Star Citizen will leave Early Access without achieving the kickstarter goals we originally set out to do.</p><p>In order to keep the servers up, we will continue selling the game on Epic store. Since the game is not fully finished, the price will be lowered to 15 USD (starting tomorrow Oct. 16).</p><p>Control over the official servers will be handed to the Something Awful moderators.</p><p>Moderators will stay in touch with us for any important events that might occur.</p><p>We are absolutely aware that many of you will find these news disappointing. This is a hard time for us. We invested a huge amount of effort and work into Star Citizen and our hearts and minds were in this project for many years. Now, Star Citizen’s development is coming to an end and we are sad that our vision for the game was not fully realized.</p><p>Once again, thank you for your support, ideas, reports, content you’ve created and everything else you’ve done for this survival expedition. Thank you immensely!</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Chris Roberts</p><p>With love from the Bahamas</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9XUEuEI.png alt=https://i.imgur.com/9XUEuEI.png></figure><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure this will make it <del>go faster</del> crash unexpectedly</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Beet Wagon</div><blockquote><p>goons should get complimentary spaceship pins for keeping this stupid game relevant imo</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Guys I got bad news I purchased a ship don&rsquo;t wanna say how much but it was a lot.

I’ve consulted with large corporations that have troubled projects; I’ve written, lectured, and taught on the subject; and I’ve acted as an expert witness in at least a few dozen cases involving failed/disputed projects.</p><p>When I was at PricewaterhouseCoopers, I reviewed documents associated with 120 or so such failed project lawsuits and noted several patterns, one of which I named “The Never-Ending Story” and described as follows (note that this is for two-party projects):</p><p>“The client contracts with the manufacturer to develop and install a system. The</p><p>project starts. The completion date slips. It keeps slipping. Each time the adjusted delivery date approaches, the project slips yet again. At some point, one of three things happens: the</p><p>manufacturer/vendor abandons the project; the client cancels the project; or the manufacturer delivers a system that the client terms wholly inadequate and unacceptable. In some cases, the effort has gone on for years, with millions of dollars spent and little to show for it.”</p><p>Star Citizen has all the indicia of a “Never-Ending Story”, with some “Irrational Exuberance” (another pattern) thrown in. The history of IT is replete with projects burning through millions, hundred of millions, and even billions of dollars without ever delivering anything meaningful. Multiple lengthy schedule slips for Star Citizen (Chris Roberts in 2013: “Star Citizen is still scheduled to come out 2015, and we’re on target for that.”) point to underlying complexity issues and/or the often-fatal error of deferring all the hard problems for the end of the project. In other words, the Star Citizen team grossly underestimated the amount of work required to achieve their goals, and I suspect they still do not have a clear development path to completion.</p><p>I’ll end with four of my favorite IT project maxims, all of which I suspect apply here:</p><p>“Start out stupid, and work up from there.” — Bruce Henderson</p><p>“In architecting a new program, all the serious mistakes are made in the first day.” — Robert Spinrad</p><p>“It is very easy to lose a day on a project. It is almost impossible to make one up.” — Robert Glass</p></blockquote><div class=poster>TheAgent</div><blockquote><p>the current HR manager at Wilmslow was a barista/waitress in 2014</p><p>in 5 years, she went from barista to fuckin HR manager lol</p><p>gals gotta be like 25</p><p>they seriously have people with no experience doing anything leading almost every fucking department</p><p>shit be crazy</p><p>where&rsquo;s that motion capture department head who was like 24</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p><strong>Star Citizen: Enjoy your coffee!
