There will therefore be a pole as for supply planes. In the first iterations, this pole will not be implemented. It will be enough to be nearby to be able to make the transfer.</p><p>On the technical level, the first iteration mainly requires having the transfer of goods between players (as for the resale of information or the transfer of UEC). They are working on it. To implement the pole between the vessels, you will especially need interfaces allowing the two pilots to align the vessels properly , which seems to be a difficulty for the moment.</p><p><strong>Bonus interview with Ulf Kürschner</strong></p><p>Communication is very important for Cloud Imperium.</p><p>Ulf believes that Star Citizen could have a place on the eSports scene in the future .

The entire codebase is nothing more than a screenshot generator which, based on certain keypresses, visually emulates the surface mechanics of a game without actually having them implemented into the codebase. It&rsquo;s not possible to fix this for a console release, because those have standards that have to be passed, and even an employee the certification people hired yesterday is going to smell this a mile off. There are no existing bugs to iron out, because the malfunctions in place are not due to code bugs, but are naturally occurring artifacts of the fakery. It&rsquo;s like asking how long it would take to change a 6-foot tall blue eyed man into a 5-foot tall brown eyed one. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong or bugged about the first man, his genetic code has determined those traits. You need to just make a new guy with the right code. The game as you see it is all it can ever be, just with more faked layers tacked on top. If they ever want to build a functioning game out of it, it all has to be scrapped and rebuilt <em>as</em> a game. So that makes my answer 3 years.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>TheAgent</div><blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>Claiming that Chris Roberts is a fraud, CIG is a money laundering front and Star Citizen is a scam is defamation. No question. There is nobody here that thinks that what you are doing is not that. I don&rsquo;t even think you actually believe that.

Yet.</p></blockquote><p>saying any of that isn&rsquo;t libelous and would be impossible to prove in court (for CIG). and yeah you can say just about whatever you want on the internet like &ldquo;I think Chris Roberts is a dumb fuckhead&rdquo; and not get in trouble for it because lol</p><p>now if a news network published a piece using fake information they knew at the time to be wrong, just to get Chris Roberts in trouble or to hurt him personally or financially, that would be something they can chase</p><p>once again Citizens have no fucking idea how the real world works and are probably too fucking old and stupid to learn</p></blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>I have over $10k invested in this game.

SQ42 and SC have always been in the hands of this or that guy over the last near decade, but they didn&rsquo;t draw this much attention to it. This was a deliberate and very public labeling of who&rsquo;s in charge of each piece, both halves of the project mentioned in the same announcement.</p><p>Original Concept incoming.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>So let me get this straight- Erin (who is based in UK) is handing off heading up Sq42 to Brian (who is based in Germany) right?</p><p>So is Brian moving to the UK?</p><p>Or are the devs working on SQ54 moving to Germany?</p><p>Or are the teams staying put and switching work from one to the other?</p><p>Either way, this all seems like a very efficient way to make games, and a good use of backer dollars.

He&rsquo;s building an interactive movie maker. This is why the emphasis is on assets and background rendering performance and sets, sets, sets, and never on any real gameplay. In Chris&rsquo;s mind, game and movie have become intertwined, and the <em>purpose</em> of the game, for his players, should be to <em>make</em> movies. It&rsquo;s so obvious now!
