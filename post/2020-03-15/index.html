This involves buying fuel (or making it), possibly responding to a distress call, and transferring fuel from one vessel to another.</p><p>Chris Robert wants the connection between the ships to be visible . There will therefore be a pole as for supply planes. In the first iterations, this pole will not be implemented. It will be enough to be nearby to be able to make the transfer.</p><p>On the technical level, the first iteration mainly requires having the transfer of goods between players (as for the resale of information or the transfer of UEC). They are working on it. To implement the pole between the vessels, you will especially need interfaces allowing the two pilots to align the vessels properly , which seems to be a difficulty for the moment.</p><p><strong>Bonus interview with Ulf Kürschner</strong></p><p>Communication is very important for Cloud Imperium.</p><p>Ulf believes that Star Citizen could have a place on the eSports scene in the future .

The entire codebase is nothing more than a screenshot generator which, based on certain keypresses, visually emulates the surface mechanics of a game without actually having them implemented into the codebase. It&rsquo;s not possible to fix this for a console release, because those have standards that have to be passed, and even an employee the certification people hired yesterday is going to smell this a mile off. There are no existing bugs to iron out, because the malfunctions in place are not due to code bugs, but are naturally occurring artifacts of the fakery. It&rsquo;s like asking how long it would take to change a 6-foot tall blue eyed man into a 5-foot tall brown eyed one. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong or bugged about the first man, his genetic code has determined those traits. You need to just make a new guy with the right code. The game as you see it is all it can ever be, just with more faked layers tacked on top. If they ever want to build a functioning game out of it, it all has to be scrapped and rebuilt <em>as</em> a game. So that makes my answer 3 years.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/TheAgent.jpg alt="TheAgent's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>Claiming that Chris Roberts is a fraud, CIG is a money laundering front and Star Citizen is a scam is defamation.

SQ42 and SC have always been in the hands of this or that guy over the last near decade, but they didn&rsquo;t draw this much attention to it. This was a deliberate and very public labeling of who&rsquo;s in charge of each piece, both halves of the project mentioned in the same announcement.</p><p>Original Concept incoming.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>So let me get this straight- Erin (who is based in UK) is handing off heading up Sq42 to Brian (who is based in Germany) right?</p><p>So is Brian moving to the UK?</p><p>Or are the devs working on SQ54 moving to Germany?</p><p>Or are the teams staying put and switching work from one to the other?</p><p>Either way, this all seems like a very efficient way to make games, and a good use of backer dollars.
