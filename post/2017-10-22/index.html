You can get away with a lot with their model (authoritative server/predicting client), but it&rsquo;s a model that only really works well for simple games with not too many moving parts, like shooters.</p><p>Take something like battlefield for example, it seems complicated at first, you have tanks, choppers, you can see how many people are in each, and so on. But making games is all about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root#Overview_of_the_code>cheating as much as you can</a>, so each vehicle is serialized to just 1 actor in netcode, with pointers to people in them, and then hit points, position, orientation (+ turret orientation, if it&rsquo;s a tank) and speed (for prediction purposes), and generally these games only run at 20-60 ticks per second and the rest is filled in by your client&rsquo;s prediction, which it does by running the same game as the server at a higher tick rate, and adjusts every time it gets an update, and it does all the pretty shit that happens on your monitor like calculating suspension physics etc.</p><p>So you get away with clients not needing much bandwidth, since there&rsquo;s a max of like 80 very simple mobile actors on a map (max players + max vehicles), less if there&rsquo;s many people in vehicles. Grenades, tank shells, bullets, etc all get simulated on each client completely independently, the clients only get the &ldquo;player throws grenade in direction&rdquo;, the server then just confirms hits when needed, which is why you once in a blue moon get killed by a grenade or bullet that wasn&rsquo;t there on your client due to local error due to latency/packet loss/whatever.</p><p>Meanwhile in star citizen every ship is like 47 actors, and spawning in a medium sized ship sends like 10MB of data over the internet so the correct variant with the correct guns, tv, shower stall, thrusters and outhouse spawns in your game, during which all the clients must wait (and, in the case of star citizen, they don&rsquo;t even render new frames while waiting apparently, so the game stutters to fuck constantly. who the fuck makes the renderer wait on network I/O, jesus fucking christ is this 1991?), and then it sends 43 different thruster updates every tick because they swivel and exhaust at random and everything grinds to a fucking halt.</p><p>At these amounts of data to track you should be using lockstep (all the clients are calculating the exact same things and only player inputs that modify results + a heartbeat to stay in sync get sent between clients), but lockstep is a slowass piece of shit that works really well for RTS games where having half a second of delay between click and shoot doesn&rsquo;t matter (see: warcraft 3, runs exactly the same with 2 players and 12 players at max capacity), but would be absolutely terrible even for the spacesim part of the game, much less star marine.</p><p>Oh, also, the server in SC isn&rsquo;t very authoritative after all, it just believes any input the clients send, so cheating is the easiest thing on earth. Or at least, it was that way when I last launched the game 2 years ago, though I see no reason that&rsquo;d have changed, seeing how nothing else has.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/mmnn.gif alt="Toops's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s ponder persistence for just a second.

Someone is sitting inside the smaller ship.</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s say I disconnect.

Most of them will span multiple tables, if not multiple schemas (like ships), and you&rsquo;ll need specific queries for each entity type, as well as all the joins, that can create, read, update, and delete that data. Think of how much work you need to do on the back-end when crobberts wants to add a new ship feature. Update all the databases, add/remove columns, create new tables, add new queries and/or re-write old ones, change the code that interacts with the database, change the nectode which sends/receives it, change the clients, etc.</p><p>There are so many types of things (domains, entities) that you need to constantly sync to the database so that if the server goes down, or when people connect to the server, they can get in sync with the game. And everyone is constantly reading from and writing to the database, sending that data over the network. How many edge-cases can you think of that could cause problems?</p><p>It&rsquo;s always the details that get you. Fidelity is a warm gun. That&rsquo;s why almost every early access game starts strong (well, <em>almost</em> every EA game…). They get a few prototypes out, everyone&rsquo;s excited.

Here&rsquo;s more questions with a lot of long answers and no filter or edits.</p><p>Q: How&rsquo;s testing this week?</p><p>A: So far, we&rsquo;ve had 4 new patches each smaller than 1GB, thanks to the delta patcher.</p><p>Q: How&rsquo;s performance in the most recent patches?</p><p>A: E and F were dogshit with constant 30K errors and CTDs. Patch G gave me 60FPS on the US server for the first time, and it didn&rsquo;t drop me to less than 30 FPS on a full server. Other Avocados reported occasional errors and CTDs, but I was able to test for a couple hours at a time and I was able to visit a few outposts in all 3 moons and Delamar without crashing constantly. <strong>Then 3.0H came around as an 800MB patch along with the Gladius-Moon focused testing and my FPS tanked back to the 20s</strong>, presumably because we were stressing full servers with as much Avocados as possible in staggered waves with military precision. That happened last night under Proxus and Underscore&rsquo;s direction while Ahmed pulled the server plug after each wave.</p><p>Q: Have there been more directed tests?</p><p>A: Besides the ones I mentioned already, no. Trading Kiosks are open for testing with the latest patch, so we might get cargo-trade-focused testing runs this weekend.</p><p>Q: Have there been new things to test since our last chat?</p><p>A: Some ships that were previously broken or floating off the landing pads are now able to be tested, like the Vanguards, Connies, Prospector, Merlin, and others. The Ursa is drivable again and the bikes are less jerky, so you can haul them to the moons and use the race track. Biker gangs are a thing now, and formation flying and QTing is online via quantum linking of ships using the COMMS MFD. Cargo and trading kiosks came online with H, so we can buy and sell cargo now with 0 profit. 1 SCU of cargo costs 10aUEC each and we can choose what ship to store them. The Caterpillar seems to have the most cargo capacity AFAIK. The Port Olisar to Levski run is the farthest and longest run, but it&rsquo;s satisfying to me. You can find cargo boxes you can carry from derelict sites and outposts that you can then sell, assuming you don&rsquo;t crash or get the dreaded errors.</p><p>Q: What&rsquo;s your favorite thing to do in 3.0?</p><p>A: Seriously? Cargo runs and exploring unmarked moon outposts. Each one has its own company or style, ie Rayari, ArcCorp, Benson, etc.. Some outposts are just small shelters, while other outposts have everything you need to settle in and take off your space suit because it has breathable atmosphere. You mean the interior? Yeah some have ASOP terminals, cargo boxes, office rooms, bunks, storage rooms, small kitchenettes, space weed rooms, laboratories, and creepy teddy bears. Outside the outposts, there are landing pads where you can spawn vehicles, various mining and industrial structures, solar panels, communication towers, and what look like moisture farms which explain the interior atmosphere in large outposts. Some outposts have NPC outlaws that you can kill to access the interior. This is done through the missions app with different categories like job, investigation and retrieval, but the mission system still needs some fixing and tweaking.</p><p>Q: How are the NPCs this time around?</p><p>A: CIG enabled them again, so they&rsquo;re running around Port Olisar and Levski, fixing shit, manning various stores, leaning on walls, scratching armpits, sitting on benches, having inaudible conversations, etc.. There&rsquo;s no NPC ships that fly around just yet. I&rsquo;d prefer it that way for ETF testing because Port Olisar is busy enough as it is with space ATC enabled and dipshits fucking around instead of following directions or using ATC. <strong>Miles still can&rsquo;t be interacted with</strong>, but I&rsquo;m sure CIG is working on it.</p><p>Q: I&rsquo;m sorry to ask again. When do you think we&rsquo;ll get PTU? CitizenCon?</p><p>A: That&rsquo;s way too optimistic. We just started the second phase of ETF testing aka cargo and trade. We&rsquo;ve yet to really test the missions system. My honest prediction is not in November or December. <strong>I know the public is dying to get their hands on 3.0, but realistically don&rsquo;t expect it by Christmas to be brutally honest.</strong> There&rsquo;s a probability that CIG will open it up to PTU on New Years&rsquo; Eve, but that&rsquo;s pure speculation and optimistic at that. I don&rsquo;t like to speculate, so please stop asking me about dates.</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hey everyone I just got a leak that everything is amazing and we are all in 60FPS biker gangs and flying in fleet formation through canyons and ships and people are everywhere there are NPCS and so much activity and mechanics going on!

Oddly the Companies House website now says they are processing for 5 days, but they were fully readable before. Here is my blog of things I made notes of as I browsed the accounts.</p><p><strong>Consolidated</strong></p><p>This year they filed their consolidated accounts. This means that rather than being just that company, the set of accounts is consolidated to include all the subsidiaries. Any transactions between subsidiaries/parent are cancelled out.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p><p>The accounts preparation improves year on year as errors get picked up. I&rsquo;ve pointed out the IP issue before and it&rsquo;s now apparent what happened here.</p><p>On the 1st of July 2015 CIG UK paid £1,359,185 for Intellectual Property. This isn&rsquo;t entirely clear but the suggestion would be that this was for the worldwide rights to Squadron 42. The sale of intangibles for £654,612 was the US rights of Squadron 42 being sold to Cloud Imperium Games Inc. Because of apparent errors in earlier sets of accounts we can&rsquo;t be sure where that £1.36m actually went to, it could quite easily be to Chris Roberts himself, or a personal services company that is essentially himself.</p><p><strong>Fixed Assets</strong></p><p>These are actually broken down for the first time since they filed consolidated accounts. In the UK they&rsquo;ve spent a little over £1m on computer equipment to December 2016. £400k on Fixtures and fittings. £300k improving the leased premises.</p><p><strong>Goodwill</strong></p><p>This is an accountancy term that represents the extra cash paid for an asset. If a company has a value of £34,851 and you pay £440,000 then in your company&rsquo;s set of accounts this is recorded as an investment of £440,000. In your consolidated group accounts however, you include the activities of the subsidiary. Because of this, you do not include that investment of £440,000. You reverse it out through a set of journals which includes the value of the assets at £34,851 and the goodwill figure of £405,149. The goodwill is then amortised (written off) over, in this example, a five year period.</p><p>As you have no doubt guessed, these are the actual figures for Cloud Imperium Games Ltd&rsquo;s purchase of Foundry 42 Ltd from Erin Roberts et al.</p><p><strong>Related parties - mistakes</strong></p><p>Note 20 on Related Parties Transactions. Accounting errors. All amounts are actually due <strong>to</strong> the respective companies, but they are in brackets so the lines that currently read &ldquo;due from&rdquo; are correct (Like a double negative).</p><p>It&rsquo;s an easy mistake to make, but it&rsquo;s surprising that a professional auditor wouldn&rsquo;t notice it instantly. All three disclosures should really read something like, &ldquo;Amounts due (to)/from&rdquo; and it would be easier all round to understand and avoid mistakes such as the one made.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Uz3drAe.jpg alt=https://i.imgur.com/Uz3drAe.jpg></figure><p><strong>Related parties - analysis</strong></p><p>There&rsquo;s three US companies under Chris Roberts control that have transactions with the UK group. These transactions, from a standard accountancy point of view, are sort of nonsensical. The flow of money however keeps changing and changed again in late 2016.</p><p>1. <ins>Roberts Space Industries Corporation.</ins> This continues to be the main money pig. The UK group tells America how much to pay and they pay. &ldquo;Costs recharged in the year&rdquo; is turnover for the UK group. As the American company settles these, a balance remains. Because of poor planning, Roberts Space Industries Corporation has actually settled more costs than the UK has recharged. The balance comes down as they adjust (Compare 2015 and 2016).</p><p>2. <ins>Cloud Imperium Games, LLC.</ins> This one is interesting. In early 2015 it relinquished the role of funding the UK group that is now undertaken by Roberts Space Industries Corporation. Now we learn in late 2016 it has gone to being dependent on the UK group for financing. &ldquo;Costs recharged in the year&rdquo; is turnover for the UK group. In 2015 it is a positive and in 2016 the figure is in brackets, which means it is no longer turnover for the UK group but an expense. Apparently some US expenses were actually paid by the UK group, so this figure is netted off that which is due to the American company.</p><p>3. <ins>Cloud Imperium Games Texas, LLC.</ins> This is a brand new entry for the UK in 2016 and it only has one figure. &ldquo;Costs recharged in the year&rdquo; is turnover for the UK group. However, this is a figure in brackets, which means it is no longer turnover for the UK group but an expense. We know this was done in late 2016 because the amounts for both CIG US companies are relatively small and remain unsettled at the year end.</p><p><strong>Related parties - conclusion</strong></p><p>What this means is that they have once again refactored the way the money moves around the companies. All sales continue to be made and received by the US companies and flow to Roberts Space Industries Corporation where it is funneled to the UK and distributed in the UK but now, going forward some will then flow back to the US to pay for Cloud Imperium Games(, LLC and Texas, LLC). Pointless.</p><p><strong>Financial Risk Management</strong></p><p>&ldquo;The Company does not actively use financial instruments as part of its financial risk management.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure how this ties into the reddit hivemind and the infamous Sunday panic statement by Ortwin. It seems pretty unlikely however that the &ldquo;pay day loan&rdquo; was some sort of hedge against currency exchange rates.</p><p><strong>Completely Speculative Conclusion</strong></p><p>Steps have been taken to change the flow of money. It appears going forward (and this means since December 2016) that perhaps nearly all the income is going to be funneled to the UK from the USA. Some of this is then moved back to the US to cover expenses in Texas and LA. This would have the appearance of higher income in the UK group. We know in 2017 that CIG UK put up a lot of collateral to secure loans. It would be in their best interest if the interim management accounts provided to banking institutions showed more turnover. Also beyond just the vanity of a higher turnover figure, there&rsquo;s the fact that the UK is now receiving its funding before studios in LA and Texas for example. The sort of thing a lender in the UK might stipulate.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Come For The Dreams, Stay For The Autopsy</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Every year Foundry 42 in Britan gets a tax credit for making a game with a certain amount of &ldquo;Britishness&rdquo; in it.

The took out a loan from Coutts bank sometime earlier this year for an advance on the tax credit they were going to receive. They just had to put up all the Squadron 42 assets as collateral in the event that they don&rsquo;t make it to the fall to cash in that tax credit.</p><p>Essentially they risked their whole company for a month of funding, not unlike getting an auto title loan to pay your electricity bill.

Anyone with the slightest modicum of intelligence can see that. The fact that they took it out in the UK meaning we all got to see it in the accounts implies the company is up to their fucking eyes in debt.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/mab.jpg alt="shrach's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>This was a summary of the activity of CIG UK specifically that strips out the inter-group transactions:</p><p>Sources of funding:</p><p>£710k Long Term Loans</p><p>£290k Short Term Creditors</p><p>£200k Shareholder Investment [1]</p><p>£650k Sale of IP to USA company</p><p><br><br><br></p><p>£1.85m Total</p><p>Outgoings:</p><p>£440k purchase of Foundry 42 Ltd from Erin Roberts and others [2]</p><p>£ 50k Admin Expenses</p><p>£1.36m IP purchase from USA company/Chris Roberts?</p><p><br><br><br></p><p>£1.85m Total</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/mab.jpg alt="shrach's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>Even the simplest concept like turnover isn&rsquo;t straight forward for the UK group. The parent company, Cloud Imperium Games UK Ltd and Foundry 42 Ltd, basically have zero turnover. It gets zeroed out in the group accounts. The only company that has actual &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; is Roberts Space Industries International Ltd. The one with the £1 balance sheet that is really a non-trading company.</p><p>But even they are uncomfortable with this being turnover. It&rsquo;s a non-trading company and the accounts make different references to it. This behaviour (calling your headline turnover, &ldquo;costs recharged in the period&rdquo;) is not in any way standard. I&rsquo;ve never even heard of this term before in an actual accountancy setting. It&rsquo;s strange but another first for CIG I guess.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qap0SyU.jpg alt=https://i.imgur.com/qap0SyU.jpg></figure></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/mab.jpg alt="shrach's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>I updated my wildly optimistic cashflow estimate for Star Citizen. The main assumptions made are the low costs for running companies in LA, Texas, and Germany compared to Manchester. Also that Subcontractors are really cheap. Yeah. I also assume that they receive $36mil this year in pledges and that refunds all time are negligible.</p><p>In this fantasy best case scenario the end of 2017 sees a cash balance of around $13mil with bank loans of $5.5mil. Obviously they could pay the loan off, but then they would have cash of $7.5mil.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/e0DibMr.jpg alt=https://i.imgur.com/e0DibMr.jpg></figure><p>It&rsquo;s worth thinking back to June 2017 though. At the end of June, Star Citizen would not yet have received their tax credit rebate in respect of 2016 some $4mil, also no estimated bank loan of $4mil against 2017 tax credits. Also their half year income was only $13mil compared to the yearly $36mil estimate. Expenses would have been half a year&rsquo;s worth. Working capital would have been tight in places. A more realistic/pessimistic estimate than mine would probably include bank loans in Germany and the United States and higher expenses in these places. It is really surreal that they still need to hit $177mil in pledges this year and this can be balanced directly with the product available at the same time, not any future product which will require ongoing funding.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/TheAgent.jpg alt="TheAgent's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>and this is from fucking jan 2017 lol</p><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/TheAgent.jpg alt="TheAgent's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>hello</p><p>all of these are god knows how credible</p><ul><li>chris roberts is transitioning away from any game or art design to focus more on company matters</li><li>someone close to chris (sean tracy??) will be handling all end stage design and art approvals</li><li>expect 3.0 features in 2018 at the minimum</li><li>sqlude is still scheduled for this year</li><li>sqlude is working off a different engine branch than 2.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.0 (???)</li><li>mocapped assets are undergoing redesigns (again)</li><li>some mocapped characters have changed due to rewrites, causing dialogue to be re-recorded</li><li>crawling/wall/fast attacking vanduul were too &ldquo;problematic,&rdquo; will now stand and fire normally</li><li>AI still broken (shooting through walls, instakilling the player, animations not firing correctly, spazzing out into the great beyond on death anim)</li><li>netcode still broken</li><li>updated design docs are forthcoming and will detail some &ldquo;minor&rdquo; changes to scope</li><li>larger ships with full player crews will be hamstrung fighting against AI ships until problems are fixed</li><li>larger battles are still not possible (<sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>2019</sub> minimum) and SC will focus more on smaller player driven skirmishes</li><li>end year sales &ldquo;barely put our nostrils above water&rdquo;</li></ul></blockquote></blockquote><p>Somebody called Cymelion a goon and he is constantly arguing on reddit about Evocatti selection being unfair.</p><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Does cymelion throw these fits only around the major CIG public events, or is he constantly in a mental breakdown mode?</p><p>Or is a deep undercover goon malfunctioning?</p><p>Stay tuned for answers and more meltdowns as the scam unfolds.</p></blockquote><p>Patience is in short supply with lots of backers and they&rsquo;re all starting to eat each other while getting constantly poked by people making fun of them.

Cymelion is in that fun position Beer was in an age ago, where he still wants the project to succeed but he has some issues with the decisions being made and my guess is he is getting really tired of copping shit from both sides of the fence for it. He has to constantly clarify that he&rsquo;s still a believer to avoid being called Derek, and I think he might eventually get to the point where he realises he&rsquo;s seen how this ends and it&rsquo;s usually with the community holding up the digital head of the &ldquo;Heretic&rdquo; up on a pike for all to see. Maybe he&rsquo;s taken part in it before, maybe not.
