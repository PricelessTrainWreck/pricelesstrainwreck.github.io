That&rsquo;s how they view Derek and all the &ldquo;haters&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>This isn&rsquo;t as knee-jerk as it sounds. The citizens probably really DID perceive Derek&rsquo;s words as <strong>INSERT AUTISTIC SCREECHING HERE</strong>. They don&rsquo;t process the content of the media they consume, they process the emotions it made them feel. No citizen can remember what Ben or Chris or Tony said in episode 172 of Reverse the Hearse two years ago. But they can remember a powerful, idolised man told them he would give them their dreams, and that&rsquo;s all that registered in their brains. Does something make them feel hyped and pumped for Star Citizen? It goes in the GOOD category, is welcomed into their worldview, and the theorycrafting begins about how awesome this will be. Does something make them feel nervous or anxious or attacked? Then it goes in the BAD category and cannot be allowed to be real, ever.</p><p>To an extent this is the basis of all marketing, but a worldview this far gone is endemic to the kind of unsocialised, poorly-socially-developed, alienated person who is most vulnerable to cult recruitment. <strong>They don&rsquo;t have the self-worth that comes from a sense of their own accomplishments and an established place in a community to allow them to properly evaluate the marketing hype.</strong> They don&rsquo;t have other voices in their lives to provide something they can compare that hype to. Actually evaluating a statement means understanding it and sorting it into concepts the reader&rsquo;s mind can grasp, and that&rsquo;s scary when the statement includes criticism of the core of your self-identity. A cultist cannot do that. <strong>Their emotions are the only legitimate response to CIG marketing a cultist will accept.</strong></p><p>Announcing a new ship? That makes them feel psyched! It&rsquo;s gonna be great flying that with their friends and their orgs, and Chris said orgs will seek you out if you have one (the Pioneer). Calling out the hefty price tag of a new ship? That makes them feel attacked, stop making them feel bad about a thing they were feeling good about a moment ago. You must be a goon or an alt or a shill or another evil word, <strong>because you want to harm me by making me feel bad.</strong> The backers evaluate all criticism by the disappointment and defensiveness the cultists themselves feel when they hear it. Not what the actual critic said.</p><p>_You don&rsquo;t embrace Star Citizen with the same level of enthusiasm I do and that makes me sad. That hurts.</p><p>Why did you hurt me? You must have wanted to hurt me. Your motive cannot have been critique or evaluation or even well-intentioned concern, it can ONLY be to hurt me. You must hate me. So you hate Star Citizen. You are coming for me and I must ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK to stop you hurting me again!_. The rest is mob mentality and nerds being shitlords in predictable ways.</p><p>We call Citizens &ldquo;manchildren&rdquo;, this is <em>how</em> they behave like children. The content doesn&rsquo;t matter, only the way it makes them feel. Intent does not matter, if it hurts them to hear your words you must have meant to hurt them. You cannot be merely a critic or just curious about the project, you must be a <strong>hater</strong> who wants to harm them.</p><p>This is why they&rsquo;re so strangely blasé about release dates and feature lists. **<em>All that matters is how awesome it will be when 3.0 is released. If not 3.0, 3.1. If not 3.1, 4.0. It&rsquo;s gonna feel so awesome.</em></p><p>This is why critical bloggers and streamers must be attacked so viciously (setting aside considerations about grey market prices). **<em>Your words make me feel sad and that hurts so you must be deliberately attacking me. I will react as if you have directly assaulted me.</em></p><p>This is why they cheered when Chris said he won&rsquo;t give release dates. <em><strong>Release dates are just words in the mouths of people who hurt us. If Chris does not make promises, the haters have less ammunition!</strong></em></p><p>This is why the hardcore cultists freeze and lock up when CIG fucks up the marketing, <em><strong>But but but CIG makes me feel GOOD and now I feel bad! Whyyyyyyyyyy…!</strong></em>.</p><p>Ultimately this is why they&rsquo;re pathologically incapable of evaluating the Crytek lawsuit. <strong><em>The lawsuit manifests in their heads as nothing but giant documents reading WE ARE HERE TO TAKE YOUR DREAMS AWAY. YES YOURS, CITIZEN 415762, YOUR DREAMS PERSONALLY. NYAR HAR HAR WE&rsquo;RE SO EVIL, SO VERY VERY EVIL</em></strong>. They don&rsquo;t see the words on the page. They don&rsquo;t respond to the points raised. They respond to their emotional reaction of knowing a lawsuit was filed. That reaction is a combination of nervousness and bravado, grasping at any passing piece of information that might provide a way back out of the scary introspection - &ldquo;mighty CIG will crush all before it!&rdquo; &ldquo;ORTWIN WILL BRING THE FUREH!&rdquo; &ldquo;This is just a Crytek cash grab!&rdquo; &ldquo;Please please please can that be true I&rsquo;m scared!&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s no point arguing with a Cultist over the substantive content of anything, lawsuit or critique or forum post, because the Citizens aren&rsquo;t reading the content. The content doesn&rsquo;t matter. The meaning doesn&rsquo;t matter. All that matters is that the lawsuit, the GOONS, the words of a critic or Chris&rsquo;s failure to play his own game or whatever it is…suddenly makes them feel anxious. So it must be rejected as hard and as thoroughly as possible to make the anxiety stop.</p><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Filthy backers, let them stare into the bog that holds their reflection and dreams forever, let the water rise above their heads as they lose themselves to the vision, let their opinions rise like so many, &lsquo;glub-glub-glubs&rsquo; to the surface, rendered mute and vacuous by their willingness to be immersed in their product.</p><p>My heart is hardened.
