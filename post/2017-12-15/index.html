Exhibit 2 of the GLA states that &ldquo;the Game does not include any content being sold and marketed separately,&rdquo; such as content &ldquo;sold and marketed as a separate, standalone PC game.&rdquo;</p><p>22. On December 16, 2015, Defendants announced that &ldquo;Squadron 42,&rdquo; a single-player video game involving space combat, would be sold separately from Star Citizen.</p><p>23. On January 29, 2016, Defendants made a further public announcement about Squadron 42, stating that it would be made available for purchase as a stand-alone video game.</p><p>**24. On February 5, 2016, Crytek notified Defendants that their plan to distribute Squadron 42 as a standalone game was not covered by the GLA&rsquo;s license, because the GLA did not grant Defendants a license to embed CryEngine in any game other than Star Citizen.</p><p>25. On February 14, 2016, Defendants moved forward with their plan for Squadron 42 notwithstanding their failure to obtain a license and began offering the video game for separate purchase. As a result, Defendants are intentionally and willfully using CryEngine without a license and in violation of copyright laws.</p><p>26. On December 23, 2016, in reference to Star Citizen and Squadron 42, Defendants announced that &ldquo;<strong>oth games are currently in development and are backed by a record-breaking $139 million crowd funded effort.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>27. Crytek has not been compensated for Defendants&rsquo; unlicensed use of Crytek technology in the Squadron 42 game, and has been substantially harmed by being deprived of that compensation, which would ordinarily include a substantial up-front payment as well as a substantial royalty on game sales.**</p></blockquote><p>lol at CIG hoisting themselves from their own petard</p><p>the great thing is you can be a layman and totally see how fucking bad this is</p><p>that filing is a goddamn bullet to the back of the head</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Virtual Captain</div><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>On May 6, 2015, Defendants began posting a series of videos online titled &ldquo;Bugsmashers.&rdquo; The videos contain excerpts of information from CryEngine that were confidential, in breach of the GLA</strong>, and should not have been shown to the public. The series continues today.</p></blockquote><p>CryEngine choice never seems to stop paying dividends‚Ä¶ in comedy gold. <img src=/img/emotes/q.gif alt="q emote" class=sa-emote></p></blockquote><div class=poster>TheAgent</div><blockquote><p>this could easily be a $50m to $100m+ lawsuit</p><blockquote><p>**B. Defendants Removed Crytek Trademarks and Copyright Notices from Their Games and Marketing Materials Without Permission</p><p>28. Sections 2.8.1, 2.8.2, and 2.8.3 of the GLA contained promises by Defendants that they would prominently display Crytek&rsquo;s trademarks and copyright notices in the Star Citizen video game and related marketing materials.**</p><p>29. Section 2.8.1 of the GLA expressly states that the &ldquo;splash screen, credits screen, documentation and packaging (if any) as well as the marketing material&rdquo; shall include &ldquo;Crytek&rsquo;s copyright notice.&rdquo;</p><p>30. Section 2.8.2 of the GLA further states the &ldquo;splash screen, credits screen, documentation and packaging (if any) as well as the marketing material&rdquo; shall prominently display both the &ldquo;Crytek&rdquo; and &ldquo;CryEngine&rdquo; trademarks.</p><p>**31. Section 2.8.3 of the GLA states that any changes to Crytek&rsquo;s trademarks and copyright notices in these materials requires &ldquo;Crytek&rsquo;s prior written approval&rdquo; and a ten day approval period.</p><p>32. In accordance with those provisions of the GLA, the Star Citizen video game initially contained a splash screen that included Crytek&rsquo;s trademarks and copyright notices:</p><p>33. Defendants knew Crytek&rsquo;s right to display its trademarks and copyright notices in the Star Citizen video game and related marketing materials was a critical component of the GLA. Yet, by at least September 24, 2016, Defendants&rsquo; co-founder Chris Roberts publicly sought to minimize Crytek&rsquo;s contribution to Star Citizen, stating that &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t call [the video game engine] CryEngine anymore, we call it Star Engine&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDROliuDczo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDROliuDczo</a>).**</p></blockquote><p>especially since CIG has stood from the hills proclaiming all their cash coming in and tracking it by the hour</p><p>lol</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Scruffpuff</div><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll see, your honor, that CIG in fact didn&rsquo;t develop ANY video games, so we move to dismiss, please.

Section 7.3 of the GLA contained a promise that Defendants would provide bug fixes and optimizations to CryEngine on at least an annual basis.</strong></p><p>41. Section 7.3 of the GLA states that &ldquo;[a]nnually during the Game&rsquo;s development period, and again upon publication of the final Game, Licensee shall provide Crytek with any bug fixes, and optimizations made to the CryEngine&rsquo;s original source code files (including CryEngine tools provided by Crytek) as a complete compilable version.&rdquo;</p><p>**42. On November 16, 2015, Crytek requested long overdue bug fixes and optimizations from Defendants. Defendants did not make a good faith effort to provide Crytek with the promised bug fixes and optimizations to the CryEngine as a complete compilable version.</p><p>43. On November 24, 2016, Crytek informed Defendants that they were in breach of Section 7.3 of the GLA. Although Defendants claimed that they were ready and willing to comply with their obligations, they did not comply.</p><p>44. On June 22, 2017, Crytek sent another letter to Defendants, again requesting the bug fixes and optimizations that were promised under the GLA. To date, Defendants have not made a good faith effort to provide Crytek with the promised bug fixes and optimizations to the CryEngine as a complete, compilable version.**</p><p>45. Crytek has been damaged by Defendants&rsquo; breach of Section 7.3 of the GLA, including for the reason that Defendants have failed to provide the technology to Crytek that they promised to Crytek under the GLA, and Crytek accordingly has not benefited from use of that technology.</p></blockquote><p>this is absolutely huge</p><p>like you can&rsquo;t just fucking do that</p><p><em>what was roberts fucking thinking</em></p><p>this isn&rsquo;t some frivolous lawsuit, this is a massive breach of almost every part of the contract they signed with crytek lol</p></blockquote><div class=poster>TheAgent</div><blockquote><p>fuck me I think this is probably the worst bomb right here</p><blockquote><p>entering a permanent injunction enjoining and restraining Defendants from continuing to possess or use the Copyrighted Work and a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring Defendants, and all those acting in concert or participation with Defendants, from infringing or encouraging, aiding or abetting others to infringe the Copyrighted Work;</p></blockquote><p>that basically means &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t use a single line from our engine, anywhere.
