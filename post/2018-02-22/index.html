With all the money spent and people put to work, I really doubt he is going to let it all be for naught in the end. But at this point, its literally the gearing up phase that the game really needs to get some groundwork done and it really shouldn&rsquo;t be rushed since a lot of the game may end up being built on top of it. Hence the drive to make good netcode now rather than later.</p></blockquote><p>I think the most I can say is this:</p><p>The first year was spent reeling from how much money was coming in. This year is about putting rubber to the road, and spending that money as best (not as fast) as possible. The sheer amount of art assets needed to fill in the game wasn&rsquo;t fully realized until mid-last year, at which point the Santa Monica office became firmly established and the other freelance studios were hired on to start work in earnest. There is a fuckton of ships to make for Star Citizen and Squadron 42, not to mention texture work, spites, human and alien avatars, animation (eased by the mo-cap studio), weapons (both FPS and spaceships), equipment, and flair. The fear last year was utterly blowing all the money on stupid shit that would take development down the road Double Fine encountered going over-budget on Broken Age, so spending was conservative (admittedly to a fault, if you consider the DFM delays a fault).</p><p><strong>This all led to the current problem of not having enough staff to produce art and assets at the pace that pledgers/fans/fence-sitters wanted (and ultimately what Roberts wants as well). Pretty much a quarter of all the artists were working on modeling one ship, sending it up to Roberts for approval on a regular basis. If Roberts didn&rsquo;t like what he saw and sent it back, you have a quarter of your entire art department on a task that went nowhere</strong>, and no other new ship assets coming in until the team finished the current one after who knows how many more send-backs. Not just for ships, but guns, hangars, CGI adverts, clothes, anything that&rsquo;d be up for public consumption in a hangar patch or YouTube video. Due to the requirement of having such high fidelity assets for SC/SQ42, fucktons of time are spent on detailing that in yesteryear could be solved with a fuddled texture over merged vertices. I mean, seemingly small stuff like landing gear goes under Roberts&rsquo; microscope. You think we&rsquo;re spergs talking about how this ship look like shit because this and that, <strong>Roberts is the sperg king when it comes to details, and to his credit (or fault depending on which side of the workflow you&rsquo;re on) he does not let much of anything visual proceed without his approval.</strong></p><p>NINJA EDIT: The above predicament isn&rsquo;t a bad one if you&rsquo;re producing at most 7 player small ships, 2 player-flyable &ldquo;capships&rdquo; and maybe 3 alien ships per race, with all the fidelity and flair promised. But all that was slated for the 6mil goal. Right now we&rsquo;re sitting at over 37.5mil. The project is WELL into double digit ships.</p><p><strong>While programmers are still being hired, the work that has been done on the netcoding, back end, servers, and tools has been going very well.</strong> However coding and programming progress is such a hard thing to demonstrate without provided visualization, (sure there are those who would understand, but let&rsquo;s face it that&rsquo;d reach maybe 20% of the audience as raw data dumps). Galway and Pedro continue to work on the music. Zane&rsquo;s got some stuff brewing. The Manchester office has hit the ground running and are taking on as much asset responsibility as Roberts will give/let/dump on them. With the massive art hiring going on, the pace should pick up such that more assets can be done alongside the primary milestone needs.</p><p>Game development.

I keep thinking Kingdom Come had a similar situation only this time they actually released the game.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Scruffpuff.jpg alt="Scruffpuff's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>What was promised on the Kickstarter was abandoned long ago. The shifting amorphous mass of bullshit that became Star Citizen, different in every backers&rsquo; imagination, held the high ground for a couple years. Now, it&rsquo;s changed again, and nobody&rsquo;s really sure where this is going, but we can safely conclude a few things based on the observable evidence:</p><p>What&rsquo;s <strong>no longer a priority</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Promised stretch goals</p></li><li><p>FPS twitch gameplay &ldquo;more lethal than COD&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Flight model based on physics and realistic thruster modeling</p></li><li><p>Any trapping of an MMO (combat, economy, repair, pirating, bounty hunting, PVP, PVE, core game loop, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Any part of the PU not related to macrotransactions</p></li></ul><p>What <strong>is still a priority</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>High-fidelity assets for screenshots</p></li><li><p>Major-league macrotransactions</p></li><li><p>Gameplay developments focused on monetization rather than gameplay</p></li><li><p>Focus on SQ42</p></li></ul><p>This is now SOTA in space. <strong>Gameplay will always take a back seat to macrotransactions; gameplay will be informed by which promises of ship &ldquo;functions&rdquo; will open the backers&rsquo; wallets the widest.</strong> If they can&rsquo;t sell bounty hunting ships, but ambulance ships for some reason sell like hotcakes, expect all hands on deck to suddenly focus on ambulance mechanics. At least on the shows - they can&rsquo;t seem to do anything at all with the game code.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/VirtualCaptain.jpg alt="Virtual Captain's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/3VVKnHr.jpg></figure></blockquote><p>**</p></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-02-20/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="February Set 4">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-02-23/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="February Set 6">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
