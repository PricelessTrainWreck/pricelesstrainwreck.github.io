The words carved on the golden pages of the Great Book of Dreams, whispered by everyone from Ben Lesnick on down:</p><p><em><strong>Star Citizen is the BEST GAME EVER</strong></em></p><p>Self-explanatory but also the tenet that needs the most proselytising and defending. Star Citizen is THE BEST and so it automatically gets associated in their minds with all the other BEST THINGS EVER (the theorycrafting, the dreams of massive battles, the org politics which every citizen expects to win, and so forth). A whole pile of weird citizen behaviour stems from the need to keep Star Citizen&rsquo;s reputation pristine - and in reality, to keep it on the pedestal in their minds. Star Citizen Good, in all things forevermore. Amen.</p><p>Enter the conspiracy theories about Big Publishing Sabotage, the furious projection of SC&rsquo;s problems onto other games, and so on. P2W? Delays? Boring missions? Even being in alpha for an alarmingly long time. You can tell exactly what the backers are worried about in Star Citizen at any given moment by reading what they&rsquo;re accusing Elite Dangerous and Line of Defence of doing.</p><p><em><strong>Star Citizen backers are an elite who have recognised an Important Project and invested in it.</strong></em></p><p>Important for tribalism and also for a sense of self-importance. Citizens are big important people. They&rsquo;re saving PC gaming, you know. That&rsquo;s why we see weird misuse of financial terminology (pledges are an &ldquo;investment&rdquo;) that can even be contradicted in the same post (&ldquo;CIG owes you NOTHING&rdquo;). Needless to say, the &ldquo;invester&rdquo; stuff gets cited when a Citizen wants to feel powerful and the Might of CIG (ironclad TOS, &ldquo;refunds are scams&rdquo;, etc) gets invoked when a Citizen feels another citizen is getting uppity.</p><p><em><strong>Chris Roberts is a genius who surrounds himself with other geniuses. He and his circle must not be judged by the standards of ordinary mortals.</strong></em></p><p>The cult of personality. You gotta have faith in the man himself. Cultists can see Star Citizen is a vastly ambitious game that would normally be impossible to make, they just tell themselves Chris can make it because he&rsquo;s a genius. A hero from their childhood. Losing faith in Chris&rsquo;s ability to make the game, or his benevolent attitude towards his followers, is repeatedly described on the refunds subreddit as the moment people decided to pull out.</p><p>This is the tenet that supports and partially fuels the LARP-like behaviour from CIG (of course Chris&rsquo;s ego supplies the rest). Chris and CIG&rsquo;s uncontested genius is essential to silencing any doubts that might form. CIG has the best people working round the clock on Star Citizen! Networking guy is a &ldquo;networking God&rdquo;, Sandi is &ldquo;the best marketer ever&rdquo;, and so forth. Any of their employees must be the Best Guys Ever At X. And it&rsquo;s entirely acceptable to spend huge sums of money to buy top talent, who are instantly promoted to being top talent just because they work at CIG.</p><p>A CIG staffer who doesn&rsquo;t act like Top Talent rankles with the faithful. This is why you&rsquo;ll sometimes see cultists furiously decry a leaver or even an indiscreet current employee as only a minor flunky. He&rsquo;s not acting right to fit the vision in their heads of CIG&rsquo;s Mighty Beings. Chris&rsquo;s and even Sandi&rsquo;s behaviour is acceptable to the cult because that&rsquo;s just how their idea of a rockstar game coder acts. It&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d do if they were him.</p><p><em><strong>I will get to fly my spaceship and it will be glorious and awesome and just like my dreams.</strong></em></p><p>&ldquo;DON&rsquo;T TOUCH THE SPACESHIPS&rdquo;. Self-explanatory and also ineeringly precise. The cultist&rsquo;s <em>specific</em> dreams are the ones that Star Citizen will conform with. How long do you think B&rsquo;Tak would last even in the game most of his fellow backers want to play? A citizen knows their ships will be amazing and totally worth the &ldquo;investment&rdquo; and let them live out whatever space dreams they&rsquo;ve brought to the table from their own lives, without interruption from awkward deaths or risk of running out of content. A Cultist will never be bad at his chosen profession especially if that profession is &ldquo;space badass&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what the faithless masses are for.</p><p>As pointed out already, CIG messes with this at their extreme peril. The Grey Market can be accepted under this tenet because &ldquo;a ship is worth the investment&rdquo;, but if CIG suggest a ship might not be as good as the citizens thought? FIRE AND WOE.</p><p><em><strong>The masses will admire the ships I pledged to back. They will wish they had one and weep tears of longing.</strong></em></p><p>The Citizens must have better ships than everyone else. They paid, dammit (in money, time, and faith), they suffered the jeers and mockeries of the knowlessmen. The Cult&rsquo;s promised heaven is a place where a Citizen can gun down latecomers and have them gasp in awe at his amaaaazing ships that he was granted as just recompense for his faith in the project. It&rsquo;s his rightful reward.</p><p><em><strong>My dreams are important to CIG.</strong></em></p><p>The theorycraft fuel. CIG is the best company and Star Citizen is the best game and it&rsquo;s going to be every good thing I ever dreamed of. The means by which CIG will design, implement, or even <em>know of</em> the Citizen&rsquo;s dreams are just a sacred mystery of the Cult.</p><p>Backers will hiss and snarl at CIG if this tenet is threatened, even though this seems contradictory to other tenets. If this comes under pressure, from CIG nailing down a mechanic or an ill-judged remark on a livestream, the cult get very angry and this morphs into a more threatening form: <strong>My dreams are shared by a silent majority who agree with me. CIG would be stupid to go against me and the secret army of backers who agree with me</strong>.</p><p>This creates one of the sadder cult beliefs - that CIG read the forums and monitor it for good ideas, so their theorycrafting will be recognised and put into the game. If one of the CIG leads said he never read Spectrum, there&rsquo;d be an explosion within hours.</p><p><em><strong>CIG will reward me for the faith I have shown. I rise in CIG&rsquo;s esteem by performing acts of faith.</strong></em></p><p>This, this this this, is where a fundamental disconnect exists between CIG and its cult, and if the cult ever do rise up it will probably be because of a fracture that starts here. I could have phrased this as &ldquo;CIG will reward me for buying more ships&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s not actually how the fandom tell <em>themselves</em> the system works. Citizens believe they will catch CIG&rsquo;s eye and be rewarded for preaching, bringing in new backers (okay that worked for a while), posting praise on the subreddits, shouting down unbelievers, and owning goons/refunders/Derek with sick burns.</p><p>Except…you don&rsquo;t rise in the fandom by showing faith. Maybe you did once - citizens can remember the days of beer shipments and gift crates and shoutouts on Around The Verse. But that doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. CIG just expect you to turn up to be milked and get very indignant when you don&rsquo;t. You gain CIG&rsquo;s attention by Buying More Ships. CIG are veeeeery careful to cloak Buying More Ships <em>as</em> having faith in Star Citizen. They call it pledging, they constantly thank backers for their support, they dole out rewards like PTU access. Backers see streamers who stream because they&rsquo;re paid by CIG marketing, but they&rsquo;re told that the streamers do it out of sheer love of the game. But the fundamental thing that gets a cultist that sweet, sweet attention from the Divine is to buy the current ship on sale. New cash only please, no melting.</p><p>CIG can only push this so far. Backers are possessive and resent any suggestion that others might be rewarded if they haven&rsquo;t shown sufficient faith (and every backer is sure they&rsquo;ve shown more faith then their neighbours). The anger around the Evocati centres on the way CIG created an inner circle whose members weren&rsquo;t considered worthy amongst the wider community. Worse, Evocati members describe a broken game even if they do so in effusive tones. They should be singing hymns of divine ecstacy.</p><p>===</p><p>I won&rsquo;t claim this maps out all the tenets. There&rsquo;s one or two around Derek I want to explore in a later post (particularly the idea that the Cult has an ideal of Derek and actually likes it when he acts in certain ways). And most of this stuff is an unspoken understanding between backers rather than things they discuss in public. I&rsquo;ve mapped these out largely by taking note of what makes Citizens rage the hardest.</p><p>But if you&rsquo;re wondering why an innocuous comment about network performance has produced an absurdly disproportionate response from the Backer Hordes…well, he contradicted one of the unspoken truths of the Faith. That must be shouted down, must must must, before it echoes for too long in a Citizen&rsquo;s mind and he starts to ask himself forbidden questions.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Cloud Imperium Games LLC updated their <a href=https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/>California Statement of Information</a> on 12/6/17 (2 years late).</p><p>The only changes of note are they finally notified the state that they are no longer on Sunset Blvd. and **they changed the business activities from &ldquo;Game Development and Publishing&rdquo; to &ldquo;Game Development&rdquo;</p><p>So maybe they need a publisher now?**</p><p>e: They also created a new LLC on 11/30/17.
