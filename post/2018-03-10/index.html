If you review the media, he show&rsquo;s ship in ship (i.e. oh wow we have physical grids now) landing. 6DOF flight, IFCS Flight, the Vanduul, a big as base, NPC&rsquo;s in a ship to interact with. All the mechanics in working order, and a game that needs funding to be completed. And the best part, it all looked FUN to play with.</p><p>However, this is not the case. It seems that Chris caught on with the &ldquo;ship bug&rdquo; and just made ships, refactoring the &ldquo;game&rdquo; everytime. This is to make it shiner as its current competitors without fully realizing any &ldquo;game&rdquo;. Elite is in v3.0, looks good as hell, and here we have Star Citizen, barely a playable shell, with screenshots, artwork and a presentation that rivals a fully working and developed game. How can these games even compete? The illusion of progress because the art is buffed everytime masks the engineering debt that it has accumulated over the years. Star Citizen still <strong>looks</strong> current gen, regardless of how you spin it. Does it work? No. But will the graphics sell? Yes.</p><p>As long as CIG keeps this &ldquo;curren gen&rdquo; polish going.

Nobody is forgiving the sub 15 FPS because they can slowly judder across an empty planet.</p><p>Chris Roberts is the perfect squirrel. Always chasing the next shiny object.

Even the biggest whale doesn&rsquo;t have the personal wealth and chutzpah to make a start-up, hire actual staff and start telling the minions how it&rsquo;s done. But this crowdfunding is a way to make it happen anyway!</p><p><strong>When it fails, they&rsquo;ll blame the stupid minions, Derek Smart, the gaming press, CryTek, goons, filthy leavers, anyone but Chris.

He can ship a crappy game with pride or brazenly quit the project ahead of time and they&rsquo;ll still not blame him. Because he is their proxy.

People get paid and the money flows from stupid whales to the economy as a whole. <strong>But when the workplace is toxic, workers are taken advantage of, etc. - then the dreamers are feeding a beast that needs to be put out of it&rsquo;s misery.

Everyone wins.</strong> But the faces in those videos look stressed and overworked. It&rsquo;s not the backers I feel empathy towards. It&rsquo;s the studio staff who could&rsquo;ve been employed under better conditions, had the money flowed to less abusive dream factories.</p><p>Is this a scam? Not really at this point. It&rsquo;s not hard to find a video showing what the product is actually like at this point, and it&rsquo;s no secret that it&rsquo;s late, buggy, etc. A few vulnerable backers probably get taken advantage of to a degree they don&rsquo;t deserve, but they could be in much worse hands. But overworked game developers watching cronies make it rich, while they slave to produce smoke and mirrors for the dreamers.
