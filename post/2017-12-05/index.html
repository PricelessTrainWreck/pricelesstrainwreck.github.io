It&rsquo;s fine to have faith in what&rsquo;s being done (to a point), but even dismissing the arguments about the financials for CIG you can&rsquo;t call what&rsquo;s come out so far a positive sign of progress. There&rsquo;s so many promises made about things to come in the future but the features that are in are so fundamentally broken it&rsquo;s difficult to fathom how they&rsquo;re just going to one day go &ldquo;Oh look it&rsquo;s all working now&rdquo; simply because they&rsquo;ve been adding stuff without fixing anything which is breaking things even more. This is the barest surface of the argument that the entire project is messed up.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a game that at its core features travel from point A to point B as one of the things people will likely be doing the most in the game, and the game struggles with even managing that without doing something like violently ejecting a crew member into space, or mangling them for no reason, or the ship just plain fucking exploding for no reason. It&rsquo;s a game where we&rsquo;ve seen someone get out of their bunk, and with the goal of walking from point A to point B died in their doorway for no good reason at all. It&rsquo;s a game full of doors, but the doors are either the greatest hindrance or bypassed by simply rubbing up against them till you clip through them. All of this at 15 to 20 frames per second on a good day when there&rsquo;s not too many people in the server, which defeats the purpose of the game since it is at its core meant to be a game featuring degrees of socialising with other players in the form of alliances, trades and conflict.</p><p>What has been released at this point is just unacceptable when set against the metric of time spent on it. You cannot hope to convince anyone here that they&rsquo;re being too harsh on this game and its developers when after so many years all they&rsquo;ve done is just dump whatever they had at the time at people&rsquo;s feet and ask for more money.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/TheAgent.jpg alt="TheAgent's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>hello</p><blockquote><p>The costs come in for the servers, the projected costs, if we do go ahead and release into beta next year [2018].

You stick that beacon in the middle of the land you want to claim and, if it&rsquo;s not owned by someone else, it becomes yours. That bit is still theory. Those are some brass balls alright!

Between super low framerates, input lag in the 2-3second range, and targets jittering all over the screen like coked up hummingbirds, it&rsquo;s next to impossible to land a shot. Even if you <em>do,</em> some asshole at CIG decided to make combat more like Elite, I guess, which means your average engagement <em>if you can hit the target</em> will take 3-4 minutes just to do enough damage that they die. And there is literally nothing stopping them from ignoring you for the 10 seconds it takes to set a jump destination and fly away if they feel like they&rsquo;re losing. Not that you could <em>tell</em> you were losing because, as far as I can see, the shield indicators don&rsquo;t work and the damage states are broken as fuck. Missiles almost never hit, and if they do hit seem to do next to no damage.</p><p>I&rsquo;m actually really excited for them to fix the FPS. The game is stable enough that it doesn&rsquo;t crash very often already, and the only reason it is so riveting is because just fighting through the lag and low FPS to land on a planet feels like a real achievement. Smooth those framerates out and people are going to get tired of wanking over landing and go try to actually <em>do things</em> in the PTU, only to realize that literally every system is either a stubbed-in placeholder, or broken, or both.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><strong>Star Citizen Defense Playbook:</strong></p><p><ins>Timeline Criticisms</ins></p><ul><li>CIG had to build a company from scratch, including hiring, building studios around the globe, etc.</li><li>R&amp;D doesn&rsquo;t count.</li><li>All those games had engines already made.
