The performance was abysmal and interdiction was off the charts but they are working hard. Many people have complained about doors still not function 6 years in or clipping issues 7 years into dev. Considering the scope of the project is expect for minor things to not work only 7 years into development is super impatient. Think about it 7 years in and many base mechanics are not working yet they remind me of Apple. Apple was brave enough to remove the headphone jack. CIG 7 years in and missing major working game mechanics and technology are open about reworking the skin shader again and that is bravery. They have done a great job of continuing to capitalize on the game with so many new digital pre-purchases and merchandising and no one should worry about CR not meeting every one of the stretch goal promises. Even if should fail everyone should stand tall and salute the CR CMD for trying to do something that has never been done before and not think to ask for refunds back.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>G0RF</div><blockquote><p>I was re-reading <a href=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/09/23/inside-the-troubled-development-of-star-citizen>Kotaku UK’s primary story</a> recently and it’s quite worth a re-read in light of the Crytek lawsuit. The entire piece is even harsher than I remembered, particularly on Chris, but also in how it exposes an organization simmering with intra-studio conflicts, internal power struggles, and resentments of Roberts’ tyrannical ego and tornadic managerial dysfunction.</p><p>The origin of their demo is discussed in well-rounded detail. With Benson talking to so many different sources — present and past employees, employees at present and past subcontractors — the tale is well rounded.</p><blockquote><p>At the same time as choosing an engine to run his prototype, Roberts was building the team that would help him make it. With no idea of whether the prototype would be a success, it didn’t make sense to set up a studio and hire staff at the beginning. Instead, <strong>Roberts set up his studio virtually and, besides a few freelancers, delegated a lot of the grunt work to third-party contractors who already had established teams of developers.</strong> He contacted Sergio Rosas, Roberts’ art director back in the 1990s, who now ran an outsourcing company called CGBot in Austin, Texas. He also hired a studio called Behaviour to create assets for the prototype.</p><p><strong>As this small team started to work on the prototype, the project attracted the attention of a couple of people working over at Crytek, the game engine’s developer. Sean Tracey, Paul Reindell and Hannes Appell were all fans of the Wing Commander games and lent a hand where they could. <ins>Appell, for instance, who is now director of cinematics on Star Citizen, created videos to show off the prototype to investors</ins></strong> using the assets that were created by Behaviour and CGBot.</p><p>Even as a prototype, Star Citizen was a global game. Chris, working out of LA, was joined by developers in San Francisco, Austin, Montreal, and Mexico (with a little help from Crytek out in Frankfurt). This early remote setup “made me think well, maybe we don&rsquo;t need to have one centralised studio”, Roberts told me. “Maybe we can spread this out and we can collaborate across the different areas and go to where the talent is.”</p><p>This setup, however, would be the start of another set of desires issues during Star Citizen’s early development: a spread-out set of developers with oceans between them faced challenges that a more centralised studio wouldn’t have. <strong>From the very beginning, CIG was using third-party contractors, remote studios, and virtual collaboration.</strong> All those choices made sense when developing the prototype, but as the team, scope, and budget of Star Citizen grew, the studio structure would have to radically adapt.</p></blockquote></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>My theory is that Chris no longer exists. You see, shortly after the birth of their children, Sandi devoured his entire head in one bite. The Chris Roberts who has been selling jpegs to nerds, therefore, is just a super high-fidelity 3d model mocapped from the inflatable sock man outside his used car dealership. The turtlenecks were to conceal the seam between the model&rsquo;s head and torso. It was a nice try but you gotta wake up pretty early in the morning to pull the wool over <em>my</em> eyes.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been a backer since the lightspeed LTI package came out. <ins><strong>Still no computer</strong></ins>, but I have an Origin 350R that I&rsquo;m itching to jump in and cruise the universe with.

No one in the industry cares. The vast majority of games don&rsquo;t even approach needing it and those that do would use a more suitable engine than CryEngine in the first place and would have better results with less effort.</p></blockquote><p>64-bit physics libraries are a thing. When dealing with physics there can be really good reasons to use double precision floating point. But to enabled &ldquo;large maps&rdquo;? Not how it&rsquo;s done in proper engines.</p><p>64 bit as the foundation of a space sim? Not as important as they claim. It&rsquo;s relevant because they want to hack this into CryEngine without changing the map-based paradigm of that engine. It&rsquo;s not a hard requirement to make an interstellar-scale space sim. Many have been made in the past with 32 or even 16 bit based engines.</p><p>The actual challenge of space sim position systems is handling the different scales and relativity/transitions between them. Trying to use a unified coordinate system for commandos, star ships, procedural birds and gas giants is wrong. There are a number of solutions, and Derek Smart among others, have succesfully implemented these in the past. The one used for StarEngine is naive, imo. And they&rsquo;re not being entirely truthful about having a seamless world, I suspect.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Beer4theBeerGod</div><blockquote><p>In November 2016 they had some convention or some other bullshit that I made the poor life choice to watch. A lot of people were expecting this to be the reveal for Squadron 42, since their stupid little webpage still said &ldquo;2016&rdquo; for the release date and they had been silent about things before that. Instead they spent the entire event talking about a myriad of bullshit ship sales and incredibly stupid features that nobody gave a shit about and then at the very end dropped something meaningless about SQ42 (I think it was a single slide or something). Meanwhile their page <em>still</em> said 2016, and did so for several days until finally changing to… 2017. Then they deleted the date.</p><p>At this point I had already studiously avoided playing the game since June when they had finally changed the TOS to eliminate the provision of a refund, so within a month I finally accepted that the risk of CIG disappearing with my money was greater than the chance of Star Citizen being remotely worth it and I got a full refund. <strong>Since then CIG has done nothing but validate my decision.</strong></p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p><strong>Worth Clicking:</strong> <a href="https:youtube.com/watch=qkteNWutOz8&amp;t=396">timestamped youtube link (396)</a> <strong>(video: Erin stammers the entire paragraph)</strong></p><p><strong>Q:</strong>And improvements to persistence as well?</p><p><strong>Erin Roberts:</strong></p><p><strong>Em… to&hellip;
