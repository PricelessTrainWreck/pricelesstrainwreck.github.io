This is not fidelity, its straightforward a man who do not know when to stop, and what&rsquo;s important to have that game finished eventually.</p><p>At this current path, we&rsquo;ll never see a finished product.**</p><p>Why in the hell do you need to keep all of the NPC&rsquo;s inside a ship all the time active, even if you&rsquo;re not looking at them? (or more specifically, not in the same room with them)</p><p>Why do you make them look at every unimportant imaginary hole in the ship?</p><p>Why make hundreds of your employees do unnecessary overcomplicated work and basically guarantee that it will never end?</p><p>Some more examples: - Wildly-over-complicated &ldquo;Item 2.0&rdquo;. Really? is it necessary to disassemble every pixel in a ship/character/element to a component with sub-items?</p><p>Every screen HAS to have a function?</p><p>Ridiculously over-analyzed schedule of every NPC?</p><p>Who gets to process all of that information? my average computer or NASA supercluster mega processing farm?</p><p>Nobody (in this case, just me in the meantime) cares if the NPC&rsquo;s on a ship have a life, as long as I don&rsquo;t see them (or see them exactly 5 seconds). Why make them still doing stuff while its not IMPORTANT? This is the reason its taking too much time. THIS IS UNIMPORTANT. And it&rsquo;s only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>SC and S42 COULD have been finished and RELEASED until now.</p><p>But no, we still don&rsquo;t have a brand new shiny system, that make every NPC in the game itch his head, because of lice in hair, so we don&rsquo;t get enough FIDELITY. They might feel uncomfortable while talking to us! (excuse my sarcasm and over-exaggeration, it&rsquo;s only to make a point)</p><p>I have plenty of respect to Ms. Roberts. He did what nobody else could have until now (unless we compare him to Elon Musk, Hm..). BUT, from the beginning it was apparent that he have a Future-creep Issue. I thought that he will calm down eventually, but no, the appetite grew stronger. I predict that we&rsquo;ll get some kind of playable content (working playable content, unlike the current state) only in about 2 years from now. And even then, it still will be Pre-Pre-Alpha.</p><p>**Disclaimer: Just before everyone downvote me into oblivion because I have the audacity to raise some criticism and concern, let me just say - I&rsquo;ve invested well above 500$ in this game until last year. No, that&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t makes me an owner of CIG, I KNOW.

In CryEngine the term &ldquo;bind&rdquo; refers to the process of delegating control of an entity to some other authority, such as a script, physics, AI, or a server. In the case of a network bound entity, the server will handle all state of the entity and synchronize with all connected clients.</p><p><strong>Out-of-the-box CryEngine doesn&rsquo;t have any granularity for this. You send all updates to all clients and there is no way to vary update frequency by importance, distance, etc. So CIG want to &ldquo;cull&rdquo; the updates of distant/unimportant entitities. There are several ways to accomplish this - but they all hinge on adding more fine-grained control over synchronization of entity updates. I would think &ldquo;bind/unbind&rdquo; refers to synchronizing on a per-player basis, completing turning on/off updates of irrelevant entities. &ldquo;Bind culling&rdquo; refers to controlling the frequency of updates on a per-player basis.</strong></p><p>Normally when engineers use very technology-specific names for such things, marketing and community management will translate it in more generic terms. But sometimes the terms bleed into common usage - &ldquo;Unit Frames&rdquo; from World of Warcraft is an example. There are no &ldquo;units&rdquo; in WoW, but it was based on the WC3 engine, so a Unit Frame is the healthbars of a character or monster.</p><p>Bind culling should have been named something with advanced entity synchronization, selective update frequency, or similar. But I agree that marketing has recognized the benefit of having a unique name for a very mundane problem. The technical newspeak helps create the illusion of innovation and mask the actual problems with just how ill-suited CryEngine is to handle the PU.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>The Titanic</div><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/wWiv8dD.jpg></figure></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-02-23/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="February Set 6">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-02-27/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="February Set 8">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
