Making it work would require some kind of flight deck mechanics and collision physics that didn&rsquo;t just give up at the first sign of two grids interacting.</p><p>The Idris, of course, is the $1.5k darling and we&rsquo;re all extremely familiar with the saga there. Will never be released for the PU in any kind of workable form due to carrier mechanics, torpedos being broken, requiring too many people/being far too large and complex for the servers/etc. The absolute avatar of ambition before design.</p><p>The Polaris is the intermediate $900-or-so ship that&rsquo;s supposed to be a torpedo boat and general single-ship carrier. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything preventing it from being released in &ldquo;Walk around and look at the corridors&rdquo; form except that it&rsquo;s fucking huge and CIG can only seem to produce about one of these ships per year.
