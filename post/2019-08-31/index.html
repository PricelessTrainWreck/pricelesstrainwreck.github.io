He may feel moved to [p. 452] complain to the police or to chase after</p><p>the operators. In the terminology of the trade, the mark may squawk, beef, or come through. From the</p><p>operators&rsquo; point of view, this kind of behavior is bad for business. It gives the members of the mob a bad</p><p>reputation with such police as have not. yet been fixed and with marks who have not yet been taken. In</p><p>order to avoid this adverse publicity, an additional phase is sometimes added at the end of the play. It is</p><p>called cooling the mark out After the blowoff has occurred, one of the operators stays with the mark and</p><p>makes an effort to keep the anger of the mark within manageable and sensible proportions. The operator</p><p>stays behind his team‑mates in the capacity of what might be called a cooler and exercises upon the</p><p>mark the art of consolation. An attempt is made to define the situation for the mark in a way that makes it</p><p>easy for him to accept the inevitable and quietly go home. The mark is given instruction in the philosophy</p><p>of taking a loss.</p><p>When we call to mind the image of a mark who has just been separated from his money, we sometimes</p><p>attempt to account for the greatness of his anger by the greatness of his financial loss. This is a narrow</p><p>view. In many cases, especially in America, the mark&rsquo;s image of himself is built up on the belief that he is</p><p>a pretty shrewd person when it comes to making deals and that he is not the sort of person who is taken</p><p>in by any- thing. The mark’s readiness to participate in a sure thing is based on more than avarice; it is</p><p>based on a feeling that he will now be able to prove to himself that he is the sort of person who can &ldquo;turn</p><p>a‑fast buck.&rdquo; For many, this capacity for high finance comes near to being a sign of masculinity and a test</p><p>of fulfilling the male role.</p><p>It is well known that persons protect themselves with all kinds of rationalizations when they have a buried</p><p>image of themselves which the facts of their status do not support. A person may tell himself many things:</p><p>that he has not been given a fair chance; that he is not really interested in becoming something else; that</p><p>the time for showing his mettle has not yet come; that the usual means of realizing his desires are</p><p>personally or morally distasteful, or require too much dull effort. By means of such defenses, a person</p><p>saves himself from committing a cardinal social sin‑the sin of defining oneself in terms of a status while</p><p>lacking the qualifications which an incumbent of that status is supposed to possess.</p></blockquote><p>TL:DR; Lando is a cooler</p><blockquote><p>In all personal‑service organizations customers or clients sometimes make complaints. A customer may</p><p>feel that he has been given service in a way that is un- acceptable to him ‑‑ a way that he inter-prets as</p><p>an offense to the conception he has of who and what he is. The manage-ment, therefore has the problem</p><p>of cooling the mark out. Frequently this function is allotted to specialists within the organiza-tion. In</p><p>restaurants of some size, for example, one of the crucial functions of the hostess is to pacify customers</p><p>whose self–conceptions have been injured by wait-resses or by the food. In large stores the complaint</p><p>department and the floorwalker perform a similar function.</p><p>One may note that a service organization does not operate in an anonymous world, as does a con mob,</p><p>and is therefore strongly obliged to make some effort to cool the mark out. An institution, after all, cannot</p><p>take it on the lam; it must pacify its marks.</p><p>One may also note that coolers in service organizations tend to view their own activity in a light that</p><p>softens the harsher details of the situation. The cooler protects himself from feelings of guilt by arguing</p><p>that the customer is not really in need of the service he expected to receive, that bad service is not really</p><p>deprivational, and that beefs and complaints are a sign of bile, not a sign of injury. In a similar way, the</p><p>con man protects himself from remorseful images of bankrupt marks by arguing that the mark is a fool</p><p>and not a full‑fledged person, possessing an inclination towards illegal gain but not the decency to admit</p><p>it or the capacity to succeed at it.</p></blockquote><p>But where do goons fit in?</p><p>Oh, there we are:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, there are barbarous ceremonies in our society, such as criminal trials and the drumming‑out ritual employed in court‑martial procedures, that are expressly designed to prevent the mark from saving his face. And even in those cases where the cooler makes an effort to make things easier for the person he is getting rid of, we often find that there are bystanders who have no such scruples.[6] <strong>Onlookers who are close enough to observe the blowoff but who are not obliged to assist in the dirty work often enjoy the scene, taking pleasure in the discomfiture of the cooler and in the destruction of the mark. What is trouble for some is Schadenfreude for others.</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Super seekret ship revealed <img src=/img/emotes/toot.gif alt="toot emote" class=sa-emote></p><p>From SC Leaks Discord.
