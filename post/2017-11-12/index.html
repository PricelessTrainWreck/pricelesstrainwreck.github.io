This causes an exponentially increasing spiral of delays that a modern experienced project manager would see coming from a mile away and know how to deal with. The project is getting ever further away from completion despite what public statements to the contrary say. These managers may have been the best of the best back in their day, but it is no longer that day and people rarely have consistent hits their entire career.</p></li><li><p>This issue is compounded by the fact that CIG pays below industry average salaries, because they correctly think many people will want the prestige of having worked on such an exciting project to be on their CV, however you also don&rsquo;t get the best talent this way.</p></li><li><p>Both the salary and management issues have caused a lot of more experienced staff who were really making the most progress to leave.

It will surely be claimed as fakery, but as with the Jennison letter, it reads as authentic, holistically informed and bitterly resigned.</p><p>One of the great remaining myths that zealots and whales cling to is that Chris, Erin, Tony and the other graybeards are wizards trained in the secret sorcery of ancient forgotten gaming magic. Their willingness to believe this is profound because decades back, the younger versions of these men delivered a nifty game here and there. Or at least had their name on one. And zealots played them at a highly impressionable age. Yet that magic they remember so fondly now was not crafted by Roberts or his cronies — the magic they recall was Youth.</p><p>The notion that Chris &amp; Co., rather than being Jedi masters of gaming, are in fact out-of-their-depth relics, hopelessly out of step with the times and simply incapable of comprehending let alone dominating 2017-era AAA gaming — it’s simply unthinkable to the zealot core.</p><p>The evidence is <em>everywhere</em>:</p><p>—The Zeno’s paradox of infinite subdivisions of distance to 3.0…</p><p>—“Welcome to BURNDOWN, our weekly look at our progress in eliminating blockers and bugs keeping us from release of the first fraction of our first of 100 star systems in the first person universe we’re claiming we can build&hellip;”</p><p>—A space sim that still hasn’t delivered a satisfying flight model after half a decade of futzing around with it&hellip;</p><p>—“I just want to sell the narrative&hellip;”</p><p>—“WORM IS NOT A JOKE!”</p><p>—The fact that their unironically admitting, in year five, that they’re closing in on their first complete game loop&hellip;</p><p>—“Legacy armor” (in a pre-Alpha!)</p><p>—“You can fit the whole of Skyrim in that crater right there&hellip;”</p><p>—Face Over IP</p><p>—and so on&hellip;</p><p>The entire project is now a NeoTokyo of bright blinking warning signs yet Chris is himself is so completely and hopelessly deluded — convinced not just of his adequacy (lol) but his supremacy — and his acolytes and enablers derive their misplaced confidence <em>in</em> him <em>from</em> him. It’s from this desperate collusive delusion that for many emerges a similar dread fear of irrelevancy. Star Citizen, while never overtly pitched as such, is their shared escape route from this fear into a utopia of relevancy, power and decisive personal agency — as the ample novellas of therycrafting so often attest. And for Chris, too, the game is meant as such, a statement to the compromised studios and evil publishers that “I’m still here and my game is BETTER than your game because I’m STILL a great Game Developer!”</p><p>How strange that only 5 or 6 years ago, a husband and wife had what surely sounds like a kick-to-curb warning, during which she told him, “If this doesn’t work out, I’m sure <em>someone</em> will hire you.”</p><p>Good thing it worked out. For both of them. For awhile anyway. But the downward spiral is well underway and everyone who can’t see it clearly senses it anyway. And the bitterest lesson of all is that Chris Roberts was given the greatest opportunity in the history of gaming — a gargantuan budget and limitless freedom — and with that freedom he destroyed the gift and left only the grim and slim hope that some salvageable mediocrity might somehow be recovered from the wreckage. We’ll see how that works out.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p><a href=https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/are-we-really-backing-a-game-anymore>Citizen</a></p><blockquote><p>I think this goes without saying, but there is a point where something turns from helping fund a game and simply pre-purchasing in game benefits. <strong>Constantly monetizing seemingly every new ship coming out feels more and more like buying trading cards for a TCG and sitting around realizing there isn&rsquo;t a way to get the full experience out of it because the final released game is still a ways away.</strong></p></blockquote><p>CIG wins as soon as they release the game.

It shows a paucity of knowledge with regards to the concept of tone or theme in fictional works. <strong>Which is fine when you&rsquo;re 10 and the reason you like Starship Troopers is you get to watch the Good Guys shoot the bugs, but when you&rsquo;re a grown adult and you don&rsquo;t understand that Captain Kirk beaming down to King&rsquo;s Landing is going to be shit, it&rsquo;s a problem.

You just didn’t try hard enough!” directly to the company that actually built the network system.</p><p>So chances are high that when CIG moved to Lumberyard, they just brought their same arena type networking and had to fix it to run on an AWS cloud, and probably gave up shortly after they realized they lacked skill to do more.</p><p>Unfortunately for a lot of groups new to AWS and cloud computing, they think they can sacrifice smart coding practices and intelligent network design by increasing the processing power and throughput of their server, and sometimes up to a point this actually works; but it kills them in the long run because their growth was tied to how fast they can make a cluster, and there is a cap. Once people reach that cap, reality hits them in the face like a freight train.</p><p>I’m not a game developer though, but I’ve developed cloud architecture and this method of thinking persists a lot unfortunately.

Does Amazon&rsquo;s Lumber Yard do well with networking? In other words, is it Lumberyard being choked by CIG&rsquo;s Frankenengine or is it an incompatibility with it?</p></blockquote><p>Nobody knows, since there are currently <strong>NO RELEASED GAMES</strong> that use LumberYard. The engine, as a whole, is all very experimental - and still in Beta.</p><p>What I do know is that the CryEngine networking layer was always rubbish; and isn&rsquo;t something that they were actively interesting in improving because most of the games the engine targeted, with simple 16-player games, with lobbies. Forget about fucking MMOs.</p><p>And in the latest LY build, they even deprecated the entire CryEngine network layer in favor of their own. Which makes sense, since AWS is network-centric and they would have top tier network engineers there.</p><p><strong>The LumberYard engine was never designed for MMO games. At all. Even AMZ states this clearly in their docs and faqs about what the engine is designed to do, and the limitations/strengths of the networking component.</strong></p><p>Whoever wants to use LY for MMO games, is i) one dumb sumbitch ii) an incompetent moron</p><p>There was also indication that they were either using, or planning to use this experimental bullshit called <a href=https://github.com/networkprotocol/yojimbo>yojimbo</a> which they were Golden backers of. If they did end up using it, fucking <img src=/img/emotes/laffo.gif alt="laffo emote" class=sa-emote> because it explains everything.</p><p>If they are now testing 60 client sessions, it&rsquo;s not because they magically came up with new networking tech (note that it&rsquo;s not listed anywhere in the dev schedule) at the spur of the moment. It&rsquo;s because they have realized that the AWS instances (<a href=https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>these are the different tiers</a>) they were usingvfor severs, are simply incapable of handling the additional shit that 3.0 is now throwing at it. Unfortunately for them, moving to higher tier AWS instances is not only going to cost them money, but it&rsquo;s also NOT going to solve the networking/connectivity problem. It&rsquo;s just going to solve the server&rsquo;s ability to just fuck off and die at some point.

It was such a ham-handed attempt at trying to scare him it kind of beggared belief but really was the first major highlight for us that people were watching this thread, feeding this information back to at the very least Sandi, and that they thought that they could try to silence dissent with the implied threat of freezing people out.

IIRC it wasn&rsquo;t until sometime between the LTI Uprisings and when Arena Commando released and the great Flight Model Wars began.

It was well contained from normal sight since most folks avoided the forum mosh pits since it was still a hopeful time and circlejerking still didn&rsquo;t require erection enhancements for a lot of the og&rsquo;s, but eventually the waters of discontent started overflowing the levees of the toxic waste pits they were consigned to.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when they came up with the &lsquo;concern&rsquo; forum, a special walled garden gulag to hide unsightly posts and naughty hints of disbelief or talk of accountability in a dungeon far from public view and even obscured from wide eyed inductees. Moderation became increasingly heavy handed as dreams continued to collide with reality, a patch a time back when they still did that and at some point they needed even more control to maintain the narrative. CIG had long since recognized r/starcitizen was where the whales really hung out anyhow, so they capitalized on the existing arrangement once the katamari&rsquo;s and Concern forum and brownshirting was no longer enough to staunch the flow coming from the cracks.</p><p>Enter, Spectrum. They made a site that&rsquo;s basically their own little North Korea that makes it easy to keep up appearances and disappear anyone/anything unbefitting of dear leader&rsquo;s visionTM but also made such a shitty mess of the forum for users that there was a critical mass herd migration to reddit. There they can generally maintain the narrative between sycophant brigades, retards on reddit, sunk cost grey marketers and good ole astroturfing etc, though outside the hugbubble of r/sc they often get drown in the bathtub of facts by non cultists that recognize the situation is laughably abnormal 6 years/160mil into this fever dream.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/hCH3sBH.png></figure></blockquote><div class=poster>VictorianQueerLit</div><blockquote><p>Banks don&rsquo;t sell you products for putting your money into your account.

Chris Roberts had wanted to make a movie and had generated 90% footage and 10% gameplay with most of his budget and the footage was largely worthless due to the work required to turn tens of millions of dollars of motion capture data into anything resembling a game with a narrative that he could sell for $60.</p><p>I think they have shifted along this path</p><ul><li>Planning to develop both games simultaneously with 4 studios</li></ul><p>(time passes)</p><ul><li>Already past their release date with tens of millions in Squadron 42, complete focus on finish it (Maintenance Mode PU)</li></ul><p>(time passes)</p><ul><li>Unable to deal with the hilarious clusterfuck Chris Roberts filmed, scope is reduced and a smaller step will be taken toward Squadron 42, further forgetting the PU (Prelude, A year without patches)</li></ul><p>(time passes)</p><ul><li>Development of anything to do with petabytes of mocap footage becomes so expensive that the forgotten PU is now front and center to make money (Fake Demos late 2016)</li></ul><p>(a lot of time passes)</p><ul><li>Once the main 2017 sales start getting closer CIG starts producing more fake demos but is now apparently struggling to develop something that actually resembles them. (3.0) Work has obviously just started on it sometime recently but they are running with it 100% and are no longer talking about Squadron 42. Due to almost bankrupting the company on Squadron 42 for years their last resort is a broken tech demo they had largely been ignoring. It&rsquo;s all they have and that leads us to now where they are frantically trying to cram more features into an ancient engine they should have never used in the first place.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s a shame that we have to speculate so much about what is actually happening at THE WORLD&rsquo;S MOST OPEN GAME DEVELOPMENT STUDIO. I&rsquo;m pretty confident about that chain of events and if I was as crazy as Derek i would probably look up all the supporting tweets and information for each step but I don&rsquo;t care enough to spend an eternity digging through endless amounts of bullshit to highlight my points.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>peter gabriel</div><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/HR6O53B.jpg></figure></blockquote><div class=poster>Derek Smart</div><blockquote><p><strong>THE EVOCATI 3.0 CLIENT TEST FIASCO</strong></p><p>So I wrote The Road To 3.0 article that the recent 48-60 client test was just a ruse and propaganda which just happens to start 2 weeks before the anniversary sales.</p><p>Like always it served no purpose other than to start propaganda ahead of the upcoming sale, as well as perhaps their testing of new (possibly .x.large) AWS tiers which they think is going to provide better experience and performance. (it’s not)</p><p>The main issue here is that they know the server can’t handle more than 10 clients in any reasonable (think combat, traversal etc) form, and that the server is still completely unstable. So, ask yourself why they’re doing these sort of client tests now, when they should be fixing bugs, getting the build complete, getting the game to run at least 16 clients – solid – before reaching for the insurmountable. It makes no sense. But it does make sense when you consider all the similar bullshit they’ve pulled these past years.</p><p>This was 48 player maxed out server. The physical core counts range from 4 to 20 cores.</p><p>Result:</p><ul><li><p>11-13 average fps – with no combat</p></li><li><p>17-25 during server start and shortly after in a ship and just flying around – no combat</p></li></ul><p>Yes, a 20 core Xeon @ 3.7Ghz can’t even handle 12 fps on average. And not even an overclocked 7700K @ 5Ghz could maintain 25 fps.</p><p>Remember, RSI/CIG keeps all this under wraps, is actively using DMCA takedowns on YouTube, Vimeo, etc to suppress this Evocati test information from getting out. For a game that’s supposedly “open development” and which backers have reportedly given $164 million to develop. As funding continues to decline (currently down -40%) drastically year on year, it’s clear to see that they are coming up with new tricks. But ignore us though, keep giving them money and wait for what comes next.</p><p><strong>NEW SHELL COMPANY</strong></p><p>In addition to the total of <a href=http://www.dereksmart.org/forums/reply/3698/>16 corporations</a> involved in this venture, a few days ago on 11/08/17, they created another one. This time a foreign entity called “Cloud Imperium LLC”. It’s not even complete yet, but you can go to <a href=https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/>https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/</a> and search for “Imperium” to pull it up.
