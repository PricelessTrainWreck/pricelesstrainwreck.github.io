There’s nobody that can just start rattling off the designs these guys should be in the know about.</p><p>Also, about the Inner Thought thing, I hope this ends up scaring their role playing crowd.

It had nothing wrong with it, and it would have been functional. The only problem is they sold this system as some kind of insane space ship with a $300 telescope attachment piece or something stupid, along with a huge diatribe about sensor mechanics and how it will all function and people felt like they could just make a game career over mastering the sensor suite. When they <em>dared</em> to imply that any fucking idiot could do it by playing a stupid game of “raise the bar and let go of the mouse when it’s in the sweet spot” like Gears of War gun reloading, people flipped out. <img src=/img/emotes/allears.gif alt="allears emote" class=sa-emote></p><p>People actually believe CR is somehow going to recreate real world science and limitless possibility and discovery in his already hugely overburdened game that can’t even get basic combat working right, nor flight mechanics for his space ships in his game about space games.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Mt4NA10.jpg alt=https://i.imgur.com/Mt4NA10.jpg></figure><p><strong>Star Citizen: I wore out a mousepad waiting for this game</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/G0RF.gif alt="G0RF's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>I probably enjoy Batgirl’s videos more than most people. Batgirl, like Clifford, fits neatly in the Evangelist camp and while I think they’re a little, uh, “batty”, they also seem pretty guileless. I don’t understand how it’s possible for Batgirl to retain the hopes she has for the project in the face of what she’s seen and experienced. It was a little easier to understand in the prior years because her “friends” Sandi and Ben gave her privileged access and she reciprocated with softball questions and an abundance of praise.</p><p>Yet Ben seems marginalized if not gone completely, and Sandi hasn’t given a new interview in quite some time.(Wise move, really, given how many regrettable things she’s said in past interviews.) Her “friends” have shut her out every bit as sharply and unexpectedly as her NPC mission giver did in SoTG. I’d assumed maybe some distance from CIG might clear the fog but no, she_still_trusts_in_cig and believes in the game.</p><p>Depending where you stand it’s either heartbreaking or hilarious that her video ends with her still hanging on to the Cargo she scored in a half hour of planet jogging. It can’t be redeemed yet can’t be discarded, either. It’s empty, pointless, a gag gift consolation prize for her time lost to a parody of a gameplay experience, yet she’s attached to it anyway. She’s assigned the meaning and worth to it that the game failed to provide or reward and I’d not be surprised if she retains it as long as persistence will allow. It’s pretty much a symbol of her faith in the dream and like hell is she going to let anyone take that away.
