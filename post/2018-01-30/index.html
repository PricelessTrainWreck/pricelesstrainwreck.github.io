Statements like that are incredibly damaging because there&rsquo;s no way to handwave it away as an alpha problem. If you don&rsquo;t like the flight model, or the game is boring, or you&rsquo;ve spent ten minutes trying to get out of your ship and you can&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;ve t-posed into the floor, you can always tell yourself that the game is still in development and then <del>spend more money</del> maintain enthusiasm. On the other hand if an actual developer says that something will be a certain way, and that particular way flies in the face of literally years of promises and <del>lies</del> marketing, then that shakes the core confidence and forces the backer to question what else about the project might not be what they paid literally thousands of dollars for. Some might have an epiphany and desperately try to squeeze what they can out of the refund process, others will accept the change and find a way to reconstruct their illusion so that this is a good thing, and meanwhile we&rsquo;ll keep laughing.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><blockquote><p>I don’t understand why they didn’t copy Eve’s mechanics for ship theft and replacement. You’d have to tweak it to reflect Star Citizen and it’s lack of manufacturing, sure, but it seems like a reasonable starting place. Grandfathered early backers have lifetime insurance on certain hulls, everyone else has to pay each time, everyone has a delay for ship replacement to impede abuse. Less-secure space has a longer delay to deter abuse by pirates, lore it up by saying its more dangerous and therefore less trade there. Hell, copy Eve’s system security and space cops too, add real teeth to theft in high-security space. <strong>The mechanics don’t seem insurmountable and makes me wonder if the real reason for the theft change is that they can’t get it to work.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Bingo. They lack the will and/or the ability to actually get persistence <em>designed</em>, let alone working. I mean fucksake, they <em>still</em> can’t figure doors out. And ramps?

So when they finally get to that point (assuming they ever do) that implementing core mechanics comes due, everyone is going to be really pissed when they start realizing how much of &ldquo;The Promise&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t going to work, or that THEIR version of Star Citizen they were pitched by CIG isn&rsquo;t going to happen.

That&rsquo;s a direct barometer of the desire for their spaceships and the last time I checked it was still at 80% value.
