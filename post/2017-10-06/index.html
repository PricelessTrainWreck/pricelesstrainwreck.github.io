These new surfaces are expansive</p><p>Oxygen Supply: Many areas, such as space or the moons of Crusader, do not have breathable atmospheres and are dangerous for characters unless they’re wearing a pressure suit. Most pressure suits are equipped standard with an oxygen tank. As you breathe, you will slowly consume the oxygen inside your tank. Your oxygen tank will automatically begin to refill once you are inside an area, station, ship or outpost with a breathable atmosphere. If your oxygen supply runs out, your pressure suit contains a small buffer of oxygen to provide you with a short amount of time to try to find an oxygen supply. If your suit is not sealed or you’re not wearing a helmet, you will not have this buffer. If you do not have any oxygen available, you will asphyxiate and quickly pass out.</p><p>Stamina: As you exert more effort by running, jumping, etc., your muscles work harder and begin to consume more oxygen. To keep up with this higher demand, your heart rate and breathing increase to provide your muscles with a steady supply of oxygen. Wearing heavier armor will increase how much effort it takes to do actions and will tire you out sooner. The more you exert yourself, the harder you breathe and the faster your oxygen supply will be depleted.</p><p>Heart Rate Monitor: The heart rate monitor on your helmet’s HUD and in your mobiGlas functions as an exertion/stamina meter. As a character exerts themselves, their heart rate increases. If a character exerts themselves too much, they will enter a Hyperventilated state. This will restrict the actions that you can perform, and things like running, sprinting or vaulting will be blocked until you exit the Hyperventilated state. Heart rate and breathing can also effect recoil handling and aim. As your heart rate increases the character’s aim will begin to sway, ranging from a minor wobble to wild drifting. Once levels reach certain critical thresholds your vision will also begin to be effected, slowly dimming till it goes completely black. Once your heart rate returns to normal, so will your vision and movement.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><blockquote><p><a href="https://go.twitch.tv/videos/180060509?t=2h3m2s">https://go.twitch.tv/videos/180060509?t=2h3m2s</a></p></blockquote><p>Umm…. that&rsquo;s just ever so slightly cult-like <img src=/img/emotes/stare.gif alt="stare emote" class=sa-emote></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>I hope someone breaks the NDA soon so I can find out just how owned we are, it&rsquo;s really stressful knowing you are owned but not how much.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Nothing screams fidelity like a seam on a moon.</p><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/unknown.png></figure></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/pa.gif alt="AP's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p><a href=https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/16158-Monthly-Studio-Report-September-2017>Monthly Studio Report: September 2017</a></p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lXld7s0.jpg alt=https://i.imgur.com/lXld7s0.jpg></figure><p>More motion capture in LA or Austin.</p><blockquote><p>The Derby Studio was busy moving into the new studio! After spending four months split between two offices, they’re finally back together under one roof where there’s a lot more space.</p><p>The Motion Capture and HeadCam systems were set up to run tests with the Audio team, who came down from Wilmslow in preparation for an upcoming shoot. The team also completed a bunch of facial animation and polished cinematic facial animations.</p><p>Over the past month, the Animation Team created assets for the Alpha 3.0 release and beyond. They have been updating the placeholder animations for the Player stopping. The goal is to provide a higher visual fidelity and realism to how Players move within the new speed gearing system. Animators also worked on jumping. They needed to balance Star Citizen’s signature high-fidelity look with a manageable amount of assets for when the animation bank is extended to the female model and various stamina types. Plus, they worked on stealth takedowns.</p><p>In addition, they worked on developing daily routine and life animations for characters and mission givers. A recent shoot in the Austin office focused on these behaviors, which the Derby team is now tracking and solving. The animators also added more life to the Star Citizen world with conversations characters have as they go about their routines. Finally, on the ship side, the team delivered updates for the Sabre ship set and captured enter/exit animations for the new ground-based vehicles.</p></blockquote><p>New Derby office mentioned.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>See, the &lsquo;bug&rsquo; thing is quite funny and very apt, but I can&rsquo;t take my eyes off all the perfectly straight &lsquo;join&rsquo; lines all perfectly parallel in alignment and all running W-E in the original image, as if googlemaps made the map for this &lsquo;moon&rsquo; from satalite photos stitched together in lines. <img src=/img/emotes/shrug.gif alt="shrug emote" class=sa-emote></p><p>See them?</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gXnZjQb.jpg alt=https://i.imgur.com/gXnZjQb.jpg></figure></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/boat.jpg alt="The Titanic's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>I feel like a broken record sometimes, but SC is built on the basis of an arena shooter with twitch type combat.</p><p>Building that framework into an mmo isn&rsquo;t a trivial task, to the point where even very low level core functionality needs to be built with an mmo type framework behind it.</p><p>What CIG is <em>trying</em> to do is streamline an arena games networking capabilities until it support hundreds of simultaneous players in a level all with twitch shooter capabilities, moving between different control styles (space, ground vehicle, personal, including all these variants with the option of being inside these objects as well).</p><p>Effectively what CR thinks he can do is take something incredibly streamlined like the GTA multiplayer system, which manages to do all these things, except set the player count to 9,000, and it will magically all work because he wants it to.</p><p>They&rsquo;re running into network issues not only because they don&rsquo;t have talent, but because they aren&rsquo;t even building an mmo yet; they&rsquo;re still working on a very shit tier multiplayer arena shooter framework and trying to ramrod more players into it than it can support.
