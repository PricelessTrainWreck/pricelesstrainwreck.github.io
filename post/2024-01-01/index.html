However, towards the end of the year, CIG reportedly managed to stabilize its finances, as indicated by data from public trackers. According to Chris Roberts in internal communications, this had indeed been a ‘record breaking year’ for the company - however they still ended the year in a deficit.</p><p>Some within CIG fear this has prompted what the company’s internal messaging calls a ‘relocation effort’. Several have detailed a contract requiring 6 months of silence in exchange for their severance packages. Notable CIG fires/losses reportedly included key leadership for the PU, causing major shakeups in structure. Comments made to PIPELINE had mentioned fears that both ATX and LA studios would soon close.</p><p>A discussion between me and a CIG representative indicates that these fears are likely overblown. While not denying the existence of layoffs, Tyler Witkin (Zyloh) had made sure to indicate that neither office had planned to close. When I had mentioned that CIG’s job hiring site had been cleared of all but one US job posting (indicating a potential hiring freeze), Tyler indicated more were incoming as well as confidently dismissing a rumor about the fate of the Austin studio as untrue</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Wait, they get their severance if they agree to only 6 months of silence?
