Shit don&rsquo;t work. You can tell yourself it&rsquo;s the best damn space sim ever as you sit on a black screen for 15+ minutes and then clip through the floor again, but it starts to sound hollow and that opens up a huge dark yawning pit in even the most cultish citizen&rsquo;s soul. So the community goes oddly quiet. The usual suspects actually shut up (right now they&rsquo;re switching between awe at the streamer vids and stewing with rage over <em>still</em> not being sufficiently devout to be blessed by the Crobbler with alpha access).</p><p>CIG themselves have worked this out. The edited version of a presentation video usually serves this role. Even the Gamescon ramp disaster was followed up a few days later by a sanitised video so the cultists could tell themselves &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I <em>really</em> saw, not what those filthy refunders said I saw&rdquo;. Then they can pledge more and Buy More Ships secure in the knowledge that the painful world they glimpsed momentarily was a lie that has been washed away.</p><p>What will ultimately kill Star Citizen and turn the mob on CIG (assuming the money doesn&rsquo;t run out) is when the reality of the game is so bad that there aren&rsquo;t any kernels left to reform around. That might well be because CIG have shat out an MVP and don&rsquo;t bother followups, or it might be because of some kind of slip-up or misjudgment.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>An amusing thing about the whole subsumption thing, is the wildly optimistic expectations many seem to have for it. It&rsquo;s just a variation of an old school behavior tree, but explicitly without a world model. So these NPCs have no memories, do not have any abstract processing of the world (or even their basic surroundings), etc. It&rsquo;s all lizard-brain. Behavior trees in combination with scripting has been at the core of game AI for decades. There is nothing revolutionary or innovative about it. But CIG certainly hasn&rsquo;t dispelled the backer notion that subsumption is cutting-edge AI. I&rsquo;d be fine with them stating they had an ambition to create cutting-edge AI, but they&rsquo;re talking about it like they have this special subsumption sauce, that&rsquo;s gonna make all the difference.

They&rsquo;re all <em>really</em> tiny, like just a few hundred km in size, and it <em>seems</em> like the only reason for that is that some moron decided to distinguish the game from Elite Dangerous by only having two flying speeds- quantum travel, and dogfighting speed. You have to fly around the planets at dogfighting speed where it takes literally 10-15 minutes to get anywhere, and if you use afterburners you&rsquo;ll run out of fuel in a couple of minutes. So instead they made all the moons super small but with earthlike atmosphere and gravity.The whole thing reeks of bad design decisions compounding each other.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Scruffpuff.jpg alt="Scruffpuff's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>nobody who backed Star Citizen in any way, shape, or form was paying for CIG to develop the game.</p><p>They were paying CIG to <em>figure out how to</em> develop the game.

And that off-line mode is valuable for testing because without the actual data set earlier on, you have no idea how you need to streamline your code down the road.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s typically the problem that Star Citizen has. They somehow figured that - untouched - the baseline CryEngine network layer was adequate. It wasn&rsquo;t - as anyone who has played a CryEngine multiplayer game will tell you.

It&rsquo;s how the PU came to be, whereby they were touting &ldquo;persistence&rdquo; despite the fact that there was nothing actually persistent (db store and pulls are not persistence) about it.</p><p>**So, right now in 3.0, hype aside - with zero optimizations to their networking - each client in a serssion sends in excess of <strong>4K bytes</strong> (I shit you not, fire up Wireshark and see) <strong>per second</strong> to the server.

But when I went to sort by controversial I noticed that you couldn&rsquo;t even do that because they&rsquo;ve disabled to option. Name one other subreddit on this entire site that does that. But luckily you can just type the url in manually and view the most controversial threads, so I did, and it was quite a different scene.</p><p><strong>This game&rsquo;s community is about as close as you can get to a cult without actually having the elements needed for the official label.

Then it struck me: Wasn&rsquo;t there a theory that in order to make planets on SC, everything on Cryengine was scaled-down from a normal map size? If so, maybe the footprint isn&rsquo;t big, they just forgot to downscale it?</p></blockquote><p>This has been my working theory for a long time. Scaling down all game objects is a cheap way to make your levels &ldquo;bigger,&rdquo; but it has disastrous effects, including breaking collisions (you can clip through things easily because your player character is approaching the collider&rsquo;s error margin), and breaking physics (mass gets screwy and everything tends to behave like balsa wood).</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/TheAgent.jpg alt="TheAgent's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>reason 1: the game is a janky piece of shit</p><p>reason 2:</p></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2017-11-26/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="November Set 8">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2017-12-01/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LAND SALES">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
