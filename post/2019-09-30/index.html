Hahahahahahaha skip skip skip</p></li><li><p>Today we are rambling about mission sharing. Devs are explaining why this fundamental mechanic that should have been included at the fucking launch of the game three years ago is very important and a big win for them. Don&rsquo;t break your wrist jerking yourselves off there, guys.</p></li><li><p>If you are too much of a crime-doer you will not be able to land at good, lawful locations. Of course you can just like, park right fucking next to them and get out? It&rsquo;s awfully nice of everyone to constantly declare that they are wanted criminals before requesting landing. No more vehicle storage for you (unless you die!) because you&rsquo;re a nasty man (unless you die) and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it (except die, which you will do instantly anyway). I guess this is why they&rsquo;re throwing in space-jail soon: obviously being a horrible crime person is clearly not aggressively shitty <em>enough</em>. Also they&rsquo;re pretending that you&rsquo;re going to be hunted by the navy and bounty hunters.</p></li><li><p>Basically don&rsquo;t do crime missions, you will get fucked and there is no recourse except a 15+ minute waiting game to remove your stat. This is good game design.</p></li><li><p>They are now patting themselves on the back for having applied scaling to the same weapon attachment model so they&rsquo;ll fit three different sizes. I&rsquo;m not kidding- it&rsquo;s the same model, just made bigger.</p></li><li><p>It is unclear if there are any mechanics attached to the attachment models that the man is showing. I would guess that no, there aren&rsquo;t.</p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;re refactoring the attachment models. Obviously the first ones they put out were just a first pass- real glad they took care of all the glaring art problems.</p></li><li><p>Good news, there is a mechanic after all! They have added a combat flashlight. It is literally blinding for anyone in front of you.</p></li><li><p>The suppressor makes your weapon sound different. Take a fucking victory lap everyone. With this many stock-standard gameplay assets that deliver no surprises whatsoever, Star Citizen is <em>sure</em> to blow the doors off of that Call of Duty Space Game that came out like 2 years ago.</p></li><li><p>I guess we&rsquo;re not talking about that interdictor ship after all. I really figured it would get all the attention but they must not be ready to sell it, or the actual mechanic doesn&rsquo;t work.</p></li><li><p>Now we&rsquo;re talking about face customization.
