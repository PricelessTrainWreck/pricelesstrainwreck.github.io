I&rsquo;ve been watching the progress from day one, with so much excitement and eagerness. I&rsquo;ve been right there beside you all, saying &ldquo;when will it be ready?&rdquo; and waiting to jump into my ship and sail the cosmos. But I feel… disenchanted. The hype train keeps on rolling, but they still haven&rsquo;t stitched things together into a single unit yet. All we&rsquo;ve had is a few simple tech demos. The scope of the game keeps changing, and new features are constantly announced, and it seems like development is charging forward&hellip; But <strong>part of me wonders if they&rsquo;re just selling us smoke and mirrors</strong> and living easy on that $150 million.</p><p>So, I guess what I&rsquo;m saying, is the thing I&rsquo;m most excited for is to actually see this game get released, and to know I didn&rsquo;t waste all that money all those years ago.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t possibly say &ldquo;this will be the only game I need&rdquo; or that it&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted,&rdquo; because I honestly don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;ll ever come out, and because I&rsquo;ve become wary of all the hype and propaganda.</p><p><strong>It feels to me an awful lot like religion… The church telling me &ldquo;spend your life dedicated to our cause and tossing your money into our coffers, and you&rsquo;ll have a boundless and beautiful reward when the rapture comes.&rdquo; Heaven will be the &ldquo;only thing I need,&rdquo;</strong> and it&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted…&rdquo; Except I&rsquo;ll never see it in my lifetime, and I won&rsquo;t be able to call home after I&rsquo;m dead to tell you whether it lived up to all the hype.</p><p>I feel jaded. <strong>I&rsquo;ve lost faith in RSI just like I lost faith in Jesus.</strong> Thankfully, Star Citizen has the potential to actually be released in my lifetime and to prove me wrong, whereas Jesus can&rsquo;t make the same claim. So, I guess I could say that I have more faith in RSI than I do in Jesus… But only a little.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t wait for this game to be released. Not because I&rsquo;m super excited to play it, but because I&rsquo;m just so ready for the stress of waiting to be over. Even if it sucks and we&rsquo;ve all wasted our money, at least we&rsquo;ll have closure.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Star Citizen has the potential to actually be released in my lifetime and to prove me wrong, whereas Jesus can&rsquo;t make the same claim</p></blockquote><p>I rolled away the <del>rock</del> Ben after three days and it turns out Star Citizen was still dead, actually</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><em>Goon 2:5</em> And in the beginning of the ELE, all was good in the Star Citizen community.

For hidden from the people, a great untruth was lying. And people knew it not. The base god of the people had maketh a falsehood and had told the people that Star Citizen was good and that they should buyeth of it, and that he would finish it, in fidelity. The fidelity was to be good and the fidelity was to be real.</p><p><em>Goon 2:7</em> But lo, a great prophet came at that time and his name was Derek. Derek was the counting of his name and the people were mightily puzzled. &lsquo;Derek&rsquo;, they cried, &lsquo;whence come thee to this land of darkness?&rsquo;</p><p><em>Goon 2:8</em> And the Derek replied &ldquo;Oh great people for whom doth thou not knowest the truth, verily this day an evil lies in the land and you can read about it in my July blog&rsquo;. And the people did readest of the July blog and it took them many days for Derek was not light of typing.</p><p><em>Goon 2:9</em> But gradually the people knew of the blog and they knew Derek. But yet, there were those who had not taketh of the blogs and they were mightily afraid.</p><p><em>Goon 2:10</em> They had come from a far off place, a land where darkness walked in perpetuity, called r/ds. They greatly envied his genitals and spoketh about them in hushed tones.</p><p><em>Goon 2:11</em> &ldquo;Oh Derek,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;Why are thy genitals so superior to ours?&rdquo;. And Derek smiled on them and blocked them.</p><p><em>Goon 2:12</em> Then it came to pass, that the owner of the land of r/ds, a man called Jester, did tire of the people from r/ds, and closed off the land to others. Derek was mightily pleased and shouted gaily, &ldquo;I closed those ass-clowns down.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Goon 2:13</em> And the people from r/ds did gnash their teeth and wail epithets at the prophet and he smiled all the more.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>after the exchange i had with the backers in the past few day i kinda dont even give a shit anymore.

Using a rope to swing across a chasm, only to trek back around the long way so they can retrieve the rope, then head home to get a better rope. The rope is too heavy, so they brought a ladder. The ladder is too short to cross the chasm. Stopping frequently to meticulously etch pebbles into detailed, microscopic figures. This one is a whale, that one a turtle, and those thirty-seven are busts of the crew members on the ship you&rsquo;ll build after crossing the desert, to sail to El Dorado. The intrepid explorers start digging for the ores and the fuels that will make the sharper tools that will carve the even more lifelike figures, and for the gems that will bring them to life.

From as low as <strong>7 FPS in a full server to 65 FPS in a fresh server</strong>, my average FPS is about 30 in a 60 player server. To me, that’s a significant improvement from 2.6.3.</p><p><strong>Q: How are NPCs coming along?</strong></p><p>A: They’re still confined to the player hubs, but they make the hubs feel alive especially Levski. The shopkeepers make comments while you browse and shop, and the space ATC guy sounds like a good guy to hang out with. NPC ships only appear during missions AFAIK. <strong>Miles and Ruto are at Levski and GrimHex, respectively, but they’re not enabled yet.</strong></p><p><strong>Q: How are the bikes and rover handling now?</strong></p><p>A: The Dragonfly is working much better than the Nox lately, while the Ursa rover is much more stable than the bikes. The Dragonfly does better in off-road terrain while the Nox works best on smooth surfaces like the race track at Deakins Outpost. The Nox still tends to flip on its side and turning with the Nox is like riding a stallion without a saddle. There’s still the issue of collision with both bikes and the rover. <strong>With the bikes, hitting a boulder on the moon surface sends you flying into the air and flipping uncontrollably. With the Ursa rover, it jumps upward when hitting obstacles and flips over.</strong> Parking the bikes into ships is still tricky where they move erratically trying to conform to the larger ship’s internal grid. Parking the rover inside the Connie is less problematic than the bikes, but it tends to slip through the cargo bay floor when closing them. That bug needs to be fixed. With Patch X, the bikes can now strafe up and down and they automatically switch from hover mode to flight mode if you can get high enough above the surface.</p><p><strong>Q: How’s ship combat? Did they really buff the Gladius?</strong></p><p>A: With a <strong>“no PVP unless stated otherwise” rule in ETF and no combat focused testing yet, I don’t know.</strong> When CIG states we can test combat among each other and combat/escort missions are fixed, I’ll let you know.
