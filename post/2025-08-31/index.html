Features that existed years ago suddenly vanish or regress with every patch. It’s like progress is a tide, and every wave takes something back.</p><p>What’s worst is the disconnect between what’s marketed and what we experience. Limited ships sold in flashy promos while gameplay systems they rely on fall apart. &ldquo;It’s Alpha&rdquo; is the shield they hold up, but that doesn’t align with how aggressively they monetize, promote events, or pretend that the core loops are ready for prime time.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not just about delays or bugs anymore.

What we need is a system where player to player interaction is irrelevant because of the absolutely ground-breaking NPC independent lives technology that CIG is definitely capable of. We&rsquo;ll need an average of at least 35 unique NPCS per location (1000&rsquo;s for the space stations) to be realistic, so that&rsquo;s 35 million unique NPCs. I&rsquo;d expect those NPCs to retain at least 10-20 megabytes of personality parameters and &ldquo;memory information&rdquo; each at least, so the servers are constantly churning at least 20 terabytes of NPC data.
