You can&rsquo;t go walk around any of them. You can fly through them and land at your little designated landing point on the outskirts, but the ability to fly through them actually highlights the fact that they&rsquo;re not real - it makes the divide between &ldquo;real&rdquo; (places you can walk around) and &ldquo;fake&rdquo; way way more obvious than if they did something like making it so you couldn&rsquo;t free-fly in the airspace around cities, and locking you to your little landing zone. I don&rsquo;t think anybody at CIG realizes it yet (and I <em>know</em> none of the fans do) but what they&rsquo;ve done is to take the old problem of a player looking at something on the skybox and thinking &ldquo;man how come I can&rsquo;t go there&rdquo; and magnified it a thousand times. That feeling that you get when you land in a station in Elite and wish you could go drive around in one of the little trucks is going to be nothing compared to the first time Star Citizen slaps you with how fake the city is.</p></blockquote><p><a href=https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/not-interiors-in-every-damn-building-slightly-smil>Sean Tracy</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Not interiors in every building scattered across the EcoSystems</strong></p><p>Hey guys,</p><p>For the sake of clarity (and my own sanity) really want to clarify something from our tools presentation in the keynote at citizen con.</p><p>Those specific tools have progressed like this.</p><p>1.

The city looks great, and there&rsquo;s a good number of NPCs wandering about or standing on chairs as dictated by their incredible AI that for some reason the further out the &lsquo;player&rsquo; gets from the centre of the station the more it seems to choose just standing in one place occupying space almost as if all of the animations are hand-crafted and they ran out of time.</p><p>2. Honestly, the city looks great when he&rsquo;s on foot. Especially helpful is that the stamina system is disabled within it so you can sprint from one end to the other without having a heart attack. It&rsquo;s single-player RPG-level quality in terms of visuals.</p><p>3. Their interaction system is still shit and unintuitive where you have to know what&rsquo;s interactable before you can focus on it to get interactions. This is seriously awful and I have no idea how people haven&rsquo;t made a fuss about having to &lsquo;look&rsquo; at some random button on your spaceship to get an Engine On option that also allows you to turn the Engine Off when it already is.</p><p>4. Flying slowly around buildings making it painfully obvious there is no code to handle collisions with them.</p><p>5. Surface of the planet looks nice.</p><p>6. Time to travel for EIGHT FUCKING MINUTES!?!? Who the fuck designed this, and Chris says it will actually take EVEN LONGER to get to a quest destination in the real game. Lmao, and they make fun of Elite for not having content.</p><p>7. Break time for tools discussion. This where shit gets real.</p><p>8. The planet-spanning city is procedurally generated because otherwise it would be completely impossible to physically do - however, the tool they present is painfully labour-intensive in terms of putting down height maps and dictating zones and stuff. Why would you need this tool if it&rsquo;s procedural? You wouldn&rsquo;t, it would be a list of rules about how buildings clump and how landing zones are spaced and what they contain. They demonstrate &lsquo;reseeding&rsquo; a neighbourhood outside of whatever Blade Runner City is called - why are the neighbourhoods generated on a different seed? The whole planet should be one seed that dictates everything. They are &lsquo;procedurally&rsquo; populating the planet with manually created content. That is buttfucking insane, and explains why previous planets were obviously copy-and-paste tiles. Visually it&rsquo;s more excusable when it&rsquo;s man-made objects that could be standardised like buildings, but the previous crater repetition makes it obvious this is how they&rsquo;re doing their generation.</p><p>9. They don&rsquo;t mention how the interior tool is connected to the building assets at all, so I&rsquo;m entirely convinced it can create impossible spaces. They have probably worked around this by giving it a smaller footprint than any of their possible buildings, or making buildings just massive squares at the street level. It&rsquo;s nothing amazing, but watching it manually place pipe assets and shit during generation is insane. Again, hugely manual labour intensive despite being sold as a time saver it is just a basic level editor with automated decoration placement.</p><p>10. I forget the other tool they showed but it had the same issues of not actually saving any labour costs above having basic tools for designing a game. Certainly not on the level that you need to generate planet-wide amounts of content.</p><p>11. Talking about placing more landing zones and populating them. The whole planet is uninteractable window-dressing outside of these landing zones, so no talk about how they&rsquo;re going to restrict people to the zones they have manually created to interact with. No reason to go to other zones because all of them will have the same basic content just shuffled a little more.</p><p>12. Wow we&rsquo;re on another planet that&rsquo;s largely the same as all the other planets we&rsquo;ve seen down to using the same smoggy smokestacks we just saw on Coruscan&rsquo;t. Apparently this is a planet where there&rsquo;s no federal oversight so there&rsquo;s some wildlife here that drifts around and eats garbage.

At 1 server a blade, that&rsquo;s essentially 64 servers per rack, give or take how they are managing their virtual machines.</p></blockquote><p>STOP TALKING!</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m sad I wasn&rsquo;t here for MoMA&rsquo;s AWS posting, because those are some really good posts to make fun of somebody for fundamentally misunderstanding how a technology works.</p><p>How many units of rack space does AWS give me when it spins up servers? Wooo</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Derek Smart</div><blockquote><div class=poster>MoMA</div><blockquote><p>How much bandwidth per client do you suppose is actually necessary if we&rsquo;re talking about refined serialized variables that now only transmit the deltas for each client instead of whole models like in the past (40-60 mb per ship down to less than 4-5mb)? Or, with zoning that was described as only exhibiting the physics, models, variables, etc for a particular zone in a particular instance as the client travels through? Are you saying that Amazon compute is incapable or that the requirements are so outlandish that it&rsquo;s not possible?</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s a load of bollocks. And as I&rsquo;m on mobile, I don&rsquo;t have time to write up a 1000 character word salad to educate on it.</p><p>This is the thing with you guys. You read shit from CIG, either don&rsquo;t understand it, or use their bullshit explanation for it. Then go utter it with the most proud proclamation.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Derek Smart</div><blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Agreed, I don&rsquo;t see AWS as a viable option for this sort of a deployment. Taking into account that this will be one of the most resource intense MMO&rsquo;s to ever be released I can&rsquo;t see it being operable on anything less that a specifically architected hardware solution. There are a very small number of hosting companies that can bring this to fruition and the costs are going to be huge for start up and maintenance of this game.</p><p>With the design costs for this game as large as they must be there is no room for the hardware solution.</p></blockquote><p>Correct. And that&rsquo;s where they screwed up. All they had to do was implement private servers and matchmaking, right off the bat. They could have made available to backers the same console server they are running. With that, backers could run and host their own fucking servers without ANY costs to CIG.</p><p>Then, like what ED did, they could use AWS for transaction, database, and master server (for the matchmaking) stuff on the backend.</p><p>But had they done that, they won&rsquo;t be selling an MMO. They&rsquo;d be selling a session based game with a cap of about 32 clients. And then all those JPEGs they&rsquo;ve been selling under the guise of building an MMO, would never have been sold. And they probably would never gotten past $65M. Let alone to $163M.</p><p>They made their bed. And they&rsquo;re going to get kicked out of it because croberts is a fucking, incompetent moron.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>TheAgent</div><blockquote><p>they are going through $50m a year, easy</p><p>like a single studio in the UK is burning through half that in a year and its documented and online and you can view that shit with your own eyeballs</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Four years ago, backers knew (well, they thought they knew) the release date of SQ42, the overall scope of SC, and had a general idea of the gameplay involving professions.</p><p>Today, after thousands of days of development, they don&rsquo;t know anything for sure about those points, besides the fact that the game will be the best ever and has the most open development.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Virtual Captain</div><blockquote><p>JLee is a concept artist or something for CIG and is understandably obsessed with every tree in the forest.</p><p><a href="https://go.twitch.tv/videos/185872800?t=55m35s">https://go.twitch.tv/videos/185872800?t=55m35s</a> 55m35s</p><p>JLee: &lsquo;Wait what did you say Chris?&rsquo;</p><p>Chris: &ldquo;[ArcCorp] was a small level and everything outside of it was, sort of uh, y-know kind-of, distan- <strong>it was basically faked</strong>&ldquo;</p><p>JLee: <strong>&ldquo;Yes, this is true.&rdquo;</strong></p><p><a href="https://go.twitch.tv/videos/185872800?t=1h3m25s">https://go.twitch.tv/videos/185872800?t=1h3m25s</a> 1h3m25s</p><p>Chris: &lsquo;We might not let players fly this close&rsquo;</p><p>JLee: &lsquo;I understand why Chris would say this, we might not want players to get too close to the population. <strong>I would rather not lock players into certain areas, maybe security drones stop you if you fly too close or blow you up.
