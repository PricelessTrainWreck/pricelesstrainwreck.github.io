Then Derek Smart appeared, contacted me personally, and we discussed what was going on, what questions I should ask CIG, and what leads to follow-up on. Turns out, Derek Smart was not wrong. I saw evidence and heard first and second-hand anecdotal reports of rampant mismanagement, nepotistic practices, and dishonest marketing plans to keep funding coming in. I confronted Roberts and Ortwin (the in-house lawyer and old friend of Roberts from his movie days) about these problems, but was met with deflecting denials or contradicting counter-claims to the opposite. This came to a head when my SA account was directly linked to myself by CIG staff, at which point I told CIG that it was time for our contract to be terminated and our interests to separate.</p><p>That should have been the end of it, right? Well, it turns out that despite making a clean exit, I too, like Derek Smart, was infused with glorious purpose. There was a story to tell. Many gaming rags have attempted to make some sense of this giant dumpster fire. But that was the problem, they tried to make sense of it. The only way to know the Star Citizen story is to embrace the madness, the surrealism, and the sheer obsession. And so, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU3uEBUBIEA&amp;list=PL7SIP0NDfM2yyHKfRmCAociCcJKZHHY0E">Sunk Cost Galaxy</a> documentary series was born.</p><p>It is currently a race to see who will not finish first: Star Citizen, or Sunk Cost Galaxy.

Like, as if selling spaceship jpgs wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, these guys are in a race to the bottom to do the most obviously underhanded shit imaginable.</p><p>At this point I think its like those Nigerian scams where they say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Nigerian Prince&rdquo; on purpose because they don&rsquo;t want anybody with half a brain responding.</p><p>If you have half a brain, you&rsquo;re just going to cause CIG problems with your eventual requests for refunds and the like.</p><p>No, at this point CIG is specifically targeting morons.

What does &ldquo;exploration&rdquo; even mean? Pretend CIG has things to explore. (Stop laughing.) If another player gets there first is it considered &ldquo;explored?&rdquo; Is it like No Man&rsquo;s Sky where you can name it? Does it fill in part of a map that used to be blank? Is this map local to the user, shared to everyone, or can you sell the cartographic data to other players so they know the lay of the land that you mapped out for them?

Some think that logically the patch number should increase from 3.9 to 3.10. With 4.0 on the Roadmap, should we expect a similarly larger leap in gameplay experience, as was seen with 2.0 or 3.0?

This was extremely cathartic for the angry citizens who want to believe- look, the company can be honest with us, even though their honesty reveals their total incompetence at every aspect of development! It was also the final straw for a bunch of fence sitters, who are now just gone. Another wave of customers driven off and yet their funding never drops.</p></li><li><p>The 3.6.1.7 or whatever patch was released from the PTU to the PU, which means virtually nothing because the only thing that was in it was a ship that costs 1000 actual dollars. Every other feature including in-game ship rentals was cut, but the excitement of having a new thing you can buy will overwhelm the remaining Citizens for a couple of days.</p></li></ul><p>I don&rsquo;t think this momentary high is going to last. It&rsquo;s the thrill of dropping a bajillion dollars on a big purchase, but regret is going to set in faster and faster. <strong>This thing is <em>useless,</em> you can&rsquo;t even fly it in-game without racking up unbelievable expenses. The game itself has made zero progress in the last 9 months except new spaceships, and they just turned around and promised that it won&rsquo;t make any progress in the <em>next</em> 9 months, either.</strong> Citizens always lose their minds over new spaceships but I think they&rsquo;re building up a tolerance- small shit like the rocket truck doesn&rsquo;t phase them anymore. The minelayer was met with a big wave of derision at first. They had to do a one-two punch of the biggest ship they&rsquo;ve released so far, <em>and</em> the annual apology tour video, and I still think we&rsquo;ll be back to anger before Citizencon in November.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><a href=https://clips.twitch.tv/SpunkyChillySowPMSTwin>https://clips.twitch.tv/SpunkyChillySowPMSTwin</a></p><p>Ha ha ha. &ldquo;If I can just make the stream last two more years for the game to release.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh man his streaming career is fucked.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/wsIj2QD.jpg></figure></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2019-08-31/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="2019 August Set 2">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2019-09-30/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="September 2019 Set 2">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
