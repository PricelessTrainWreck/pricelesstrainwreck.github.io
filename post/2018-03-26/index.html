I wonder if they&rsquo;ve actually got the turrets working? My money is on no.</p><p>4:00- <strong>Massive salvage arm! Doesn&rsquo;t work.

Period. And what I mean by &ldquo;feature complete&rdquo; is &ldquo;core gameplay systems are all present.&rdquo; Not a few. Not most. ALL. Now, maybe you only have a couple levels done. Maybe your boss fight mechanics are overly simplistic. Maybe your art assets are placeholder. Maybe you need to hire some hotshot to write genius-level shaders to bump the graphical fidelity, or pull in top-level artists to build production-ready models. But <strong>the purpose of an alpha is to experience the philosophy of your game and answer one question: &ldquo;Is this fun or not?&rdquo;</strong> Is this gonna work? Will this foundation support the weight required for a memorable experience?</p><p>If Chris Roberts truly was the visionary he says he is, Star Citizen would be fun already. It would be obvious.</p><p>But Alpha isn&rsquo;t a terminal state in development, and that&rsquo;s why the term is confusing. If the answer to &ldquo;is it fun?&rdquo; is demonstrably &ldquo;no&rdquo; or even &ldquo;not quite,&rdquo; you need to figure out why and iterate. That might mean tweaking existing systems, scrapping some, adding others, or (most likely) some combination of those. But when you say &ldquo;We hit alpha!&rdquo; you are saying &ldquo;This is the game! It will be longer than this, but if the game is to be good and fun, you will feel it, now.&rdquo;</p><p>This is where your code, your process, and your culture dictates your game&rsquo;s success or failure. If you have talented managers and engineers, they will have already designed the game in a way that&rsquo;s iterable. <strong>Changing code is destructive. Re-doing models is destructive. These activities all have a time-cost. If your code is a messy, incomprehensible, tangled, panic-ridden, crunch-driven, tightly-coupled acid trip, where &ldquo;everything&rsquo;s like, connected man!&rdquo; and touching one tiny part breaks the whole machine, you will fail. Straight up, you&rsquo;re done. What you got is what you got. This is the point at which publishers pull the plug on failing projects. Your first shot at it was way off, and it&rsquo;s clear that starting over would be faster than fixing this mess. And I&rsquo;m telling you right now, Star Citizen is a perfect diamond bullet of engineering failure in that regard.</strong> You&rsquo;re seeing it play out in real time. That fact was evident to anyone with experience in this industry as early as 2015.</p><p>When I heard Illfonic on ATV, visibly and audibly dejected, week after painful week making no progress after months-long merge-hell, I knew that Star Citizen was a complete failure, because how did they get there? I knew CIG would go dark on Star Marine, because how could they possibly be honest about their complete project management incompetence and uphold &ldquo;the vision&rdquo; that fueled their very existence? And whaddya know, CIG went dark.</p><p>I&rsquo;m saying this as a means of strengthening your thesis that CIG is doing things backwards. It&rsquo;s very evident to me that CIG <em>still</em> has absolutely <em>no idea</em> what the game called &ldquo;Star Citizen&rdquo; is supposed to be.</p><p><strong>The tragedy for me, and what makes this so hard to stomach, is that CIG is literally exploiting every heartless technique in the book to trick people into giving them more money, just so they can continue to fail at everything they attempt.</strong></p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> I think most of the confusion around the term &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; comes from this era of &ldquo;early access.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re playing an &ldquo;early access&rdquo; build of a game, you are playing a pre-alpha build, by definition. It&rsquo;s just that &ldquo;pre-alpha&rdquo; has a slightly negative connotation that roughly approaches &ldquo;early&rdquo; which, in turn, implies &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not quite sure just what the hell we&rsquo;re doing yet.&rdquo; This is not a scary word for developers, because they spend almost the entirety of their professional lives in this state. But it&rsquo;s scary to paying customers. I love early access, because to me, it&rsquo;s fun to participate in the process. When I worked in this industry, I was a part of both successful and horrible games, and from that vantage it&rsquo;s endlessly fascinating to watch the humanity (of both developer and consumer) behind the immensely complex process of building a technological work of art. When it comes to Star Citizen, the entire endeavor: manager, engineer, HR rep, executive, backer, fan, media representative… ALL of them, almost without exception, are worthy of ridicule and scorn. <strong>This is, beyond any doubt, the worst game development project I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</strong></p><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/D4KGZsC.gif></figure></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-03-24/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="March Set 8">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2019-08-31/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="2019 August Set 2">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
