It was awesome to see them say that they signed a 2 million dollar contact with a sinking ship in its filling to the judge. But if you have 178 mill who cares about wasting 2mill if it helps speed up the development and better fidelity. Looks like crytek is on the ropes trying to get access to ly so they can help develop there own engine is how I see it. One thing this is bothersome is why did Chris deleted the agreement to show were all the money went if he did not produce the game in the time he allotted? I&rsquo;m sure he had a good reason to withhold the financials from us since he so open on everything else. Maybe the discovery will help show that they have spent very little since Chris stated he&rsquo;s so efficient he can operate on fifth of the money compared to any other AAA studio.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/VirtualCaptain.jpg alt="Virtual Captain's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>_&ldquo;Defendants deduce that Crytek sues out of: wounded</p><p>pride resulting from Defendants&rsquo; move from CryEngine to Lumberyard; rapacity</p><p>toward the crowdfunding amounts raised by Defendants to develop and produce the</p><p>products; hope that filing this lawsuit will cause Defendants so much distraction and</p><p>legal expense that they would rather pay Crytek, a company that has experienced a</p><p>significant financial downturn in the last several years, a much-needed infusion of</p><p>capital to make the lawsuit go away; and resentment over the fact that many of its</p><p>employees abandoned Crytek which could not afford to pay them.&rdquo;_</p><p>Whaaaa-<strong>HAHAHAHAHA</strong></p><p>I thought this had to be goonie FUD when I saw it on discord. <strong>NOPE.</strong> pdf page 4.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>CIG is writing these things for their moronic userbase to go &ldquo;daaaaamn! sick burns yo!&rdquo;</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Derek Smart</div><blockquote><p>CIG knows they&rsquo;re fucked.</p><p>My analysis of the latest filing:</p><p><a href=https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/968845172279783456.html>https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/968845172279783456.html</a></p><blockquote><p>That Crytek opted to start the discovery ball rolling ahead of the judge&rsquo;s MtD ruling, shows that they are confident that she will toss it in part or in whole.</p><p>This Crytek filing is also a sort of complaint/notice to the court that CIG are not only being abusive to the process, but are also stonewalling the process by raising the same ludicrous points they did in the previous filings - and indeed the MtD itself.</p><p>Stalling and stonewalling tactics during discovery, are classic.
