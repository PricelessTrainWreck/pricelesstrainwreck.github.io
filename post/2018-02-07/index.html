I will not and won&rsquo;t ever utter a word about that. What I will talk about is scope and it&rsquo;s ongoing reduction; something our backers should know and understand now, and not when it suddenly confronts them.</p><p><strong>I want to discuss the often quoted &ldquo;game development,&rdquo; specifically when I see our backers pair this with &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; Game development is volatile, undoubtably; the mechanics you most want in are often the the mechanics left on the cutting room floor.</strong></p><p>Before I get into why this is dangerous – especially for our product &ndash; I want to talk about why I am posting this anonymously through a source that has their own complications. <strong>I don&rsquo;t think [TheAgent] is the most objective source, nor do I consider them without bias. I admit [they] have an overloaded sense of the dramatic which often borders the absurd. [They] don&rsquo;t, however, post this across the internet. It seems this is something of a Something Awful &ldquo;exclusive,&rdquo; meant for a certain reader. It can be taken jokingly and dismissed, but still read; which is my intention. <ins>By informing some backers slowly of the why of these changes are happening, I hope to prevent shock when the eventual happens.</ins></strong></p><p><strong>Let me be clear and plain: mechanics for space flight, ground and space combat, trading and basic professions are 18 to 24 months away.</strong> This means out of our pre-alpha testbed and working how we want them to work. Notice that this might clash with how you, the backer, wants them to work.</p><p><strong>18 to 24 months. For basic things. What this means, ultimately, is that things we&rsquo;ve sold you – things you have already purchased &ndash; will have drastic changes and reductions. I&rsquo;m not suggesting you refund; in fact, quite the opposite. In order to fulfil your earlier purchases &ndash; even in reduced form &ndash; we need you to pledge more. By internal estimates, we have another $200 million worth of tech that needs to be created, implemented, tested and released. This can take anywhere from 4 to 8 more years. 4 is best case, expecting no turnovers or unexpected problems &ndash; which their always are.</strong></p><p><strong>Creating ground combat on a massive scale hasn&rsquo;t begun prototyping. We dont have any idea how space combat could change ground combat or vice versa. These things are years and years out; just getting to the point where we are now has been a massive undertaking.</strong></p><p>What you are expecting – to be frank, let me use some colorful language &ndash; tone it the fuck down. <strong>You are not going to have 1,000 player battles by the end of the decade. You are not going to have AI crew on your ships by the end of the decade. You are not going to have an entire universe to explore by the end of the decade.</strong></p><p>What you will have – what we hope you&rsquo;ll have &ndash; is a great, fun and exciting space game that seamlessly blends combat, exploration, trading and socializing.</p><p>I want to take a sec to remind each and every one of you how much you mean to us, this project, and even Chris himself. We get painted in a negative light across a lot of different places, but we are not, and never have been, anything but 100% dedicated to this project and it&rsquo;s fans.</p><p>I want to personally &ndash; and anonymously &ndash; thank you. Thank you for believing in us. For keeping us working, for keeping us dreaming, and keeping us dedicated to making the greatest space game that&rsquo;s ever been created.</p><p>Thank you.</p></blockquote></blockquote><div class=poster>Virtual Captain</div><blockquote><p>Reminder for the CIG intern and the guy checking how his e-mail was received:</p><div class=poster>Scruffpuff</div><blockquote><p>CIG keeps showing these small, incremental pieces of complete bullshit, and passes each and every one of them off as progress toward some amorphous goal and endpoint. <strong>No, CIG, you&rsquo;re not X% completed - you&rsquo;re 0% completed, and you&rsquo;ll always be 0% completed no matter how much work you do, because your core technology is impossible as designed and built.</strong> You fucked up from the jump, and now you&rsquo;re full-on fucked and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it except scrap everything, fire Chris, start all over again, and plan it right.

The truly amazing thing to me, and this comes back to haunt me again and again, is the nagging feeling that the backers do not actually want the game.</strong> Here is how I come by that realization:</p><p>**- The biggest obstacle keeping Star Citizen from being released; in fact, the one and only reason it&rsquo;s literally impossible for it to be released in any way resembling the backers&rsquo; wishes, is Chris Roberts himself</p><ul><li><p>If backers truly wanted this game, they would rage hard against Chris - they would demand his removal and his replacement</p></li><li><p>Backers do not do this - rather they defend and protect him (by extension defending and protecting the one man completely destroying their dream game)</p></li><li><p>Hence they do not want Star Citizen released**</p></li></ul><p>So if they don&rsquo;t want the game released, the best way to do that is to make sure Chris Roberts stays where he is, continues his staggering and unprecedented levels of ineptitude, continues his lying, scamming, and stealing, and just generally continues to get on with the behavior that has defined his parasitic life.</p><p>It&rsquo;s basically a cult dedicated to negating its own existence. Rather high-concept for a collection of furries and pedophiles.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Beer4theBeerGod</div><blockquote><p>Consider that people are still taking Star Citizen seriously. Chris certainly isn&rsquo;t. The developers certainly aren&rsquo;t.

Chris is a joke. Derek is a broken clock. The rest of the staff stopped giving a shit and are just trying to collect a paycheck. The product is an unsustainable mess. The backers who are left have proven themselves to be insufferable fools who deserve to have their money wasted… assuming they&rsquo;re not paid shills.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no reason to counter their arguments. They don&rsquo;t care any more than I do about hearing about how great Star Citizen is. There&rsquo;s no reason to listen to anything CIG says; it&rsquo;s all lies with the sole purpose of exploiting the gullible. It&rsquo;s all a giant joke and the punchline is Chris&rsquo;s bank account.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>I think a large problem with SC that people take issue with is that you have a company that is constantly generating engineering debt to obtain more funding for development of a game that appears to be in perpetual alpha with no end in sight. <strong>Every deadline has been missed by months, every statement about the current status of the project and expected releases has been demonstrably false to the point that they had to know they were lying when they made those statements, and literally you have what appears to be the most heinous rabid fanbase on the planet that goes out of their way to promote SC in a way that makes bitcoin shittards look like normal people.</strong></p><p>How do you explain what looks like the complete inability for fans to have introspection into why they make the statements they do, or why they have what looks like a cult-like following for a game?</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>And it never will end.

He tells it as he believes it 100% of the time!</p><p>You can’t just say “this is a lie” or “that is a lie” because really who’s to say what a lie is?

And then shields on top of that.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There’s pirates in the PU that are supposed to be weaker than player ships. So instead of giving them less health - which requires an entirely separate ship - we can have the same ship the player has and just fit a weaker version of the armour to it.</p></blockquote><p>So they were fixing everything manually and bloating the download with an entire ship copy? lol</p><blockquote><p>a common one people say, “The weapons don’t feel like they&rsquo;re doing enough damage,” and aside from the weapons perhaps not doing enough damage, that is quite often from network desync - your pips are on something as a client and you feel you should be hitting them but somewhere between the client and the server it goes slightly amiss and then suddenly you&rsquo;re not hitting anything. You feel as a player that you should be hitting them but you&rsquo;re not.

We gave the civilian armours a multiplier of 0.9 so that times the damage by 0.9 so that lessens it a bit. But military ships would have 0.7 or 0.6 so the would take less damage overall. So even if the ships … the Gladius and, say, the 300 they’re roughly the same size with the same amount of health but the Gladius will take more hits because it’s got better armour on. That’s … we prefer to have that rather than just giving Gladius an extra 3000 health because it’s tidier at the end of the day.</p></blockquote><p>What they are doing seems a little backwards to me. 0.7 is armor than 0.9? Maybe they are doing this but 0 for no armor and 1 for perfect armor makes more sense to programmers, then find the inverse in the dmg logic or at compile.

To use a deliberately exaggerated example, if I fire my super badass Star Blazers wave motion gun at a ship with 0.5 armor, only half the damage gets through.

Star Citizen isn&rsquo;t a game. It&rsquo;s a TV show about a bunch of characters making a game. <strong>It&rsquo;s basically This is Spinal Tap except people think the band is real. The flight model is never going to get resolved for the same reason Gilligan can never get off the Island. If it gets resolved the show is over. Our debating this on the forums has just become part of the show. It gives legitimacy to all this. We are arguing about hypotheticals for a game that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</strong> If we take Chris&rsquo;s demo at face value the combat experience will be little more than a mini game for an interactive movie anyway, of the hour and a half of gameplay we saw combat was what, a minute and a half of the experience give or take? It does make you wonder about how people devote themselves to it. It&rsquo;s like devoting your life to bejeweled or something.</p><p>If this shit was real all this would have been laid out day one. Instead we get &ldquo;Wing Commander with physics,&rdquo; Switching between PVP and PVE without affecting other players, Control schemes for different types of game active at the same time, the loudest Rock and Roll band in history! etc. All these impossible completely mutually exclusive concepts that we only accept due to the human propensity towards confirmation bias. I&rsquo;ve been playing Hellion quite a bit lately. It&rsquo;s not even a popular game really but I like it. <strong>Once you spend some time outside the bubble and interact with a normal community you look back and wonder wtf is going on here. It&rsquo;s like battered wife syndrome. People over there give feedback and bitch like any community but everyone knows what game they&rsquo;re making. Feedback is focused and makes sense. Here everyone just believes it&rsquo;s going to be whatever they want it to be. The greatest space sim ever made and exactly what we all want.</strong> Even though we&rsquo;re all different. I&rsquo;d seriously recommend getting out of the bubble for a while. When you&rsquo;re outside the bubble and you think about how &ldquo;the team&rdquo; worked for years on revolutionary technology that would allow the game to update to a new version without having to download the whole game or about how they have been working for years on groundbreaking unheard of technology like the ability to play as either a man or a woman, in the same game! When you start buying into all this you need to step back and think about things. Not you personally but every one of us. <strong>Of the 400 employees they have what, 3 people that work on net code? For a supposed MMO? It&rsquo;s just a show.</strong> Speaking of 3 people the 4 or so dudes making Hellion sailed past Star Citizen long ago in terms of features and it&rsquo;s only been in development for less than 2 years.</p><p>If a game comes of this it will be because so much money has been thrown at the show that it just ends up getting made. The Monkees had a hit song and they weren&rsquo;t a real band. The song was made for the show but it wasn&rsquo;t the point. The point of the Monkees was the show about the band not the band actually touring. The problem is what kind of game will it end up being? I don&rsquo;t think anyone gives a shit really. That&rsquo;s why everything can be everything to everyone and seasoned game developers act like it&rsquo;s ok. Because it ultimately doesn&rsquo;t matter in the end. If the game ever got made the shows over. They&rsquo;d have picked a control scheme long ago for example if they honestly wanted to make a real game. <strong>Just keep the fantasy going. Maybe the Castaways will get off the Island in next weeks episode. Just stay tuned.</strong></p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fU3PEaZ.gif alt=https://i.imgur.com/fU3PEaZ.gif></figure></blockquote></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-02-01/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="February Set 1">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-02-08/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="February 9th Anticipation Station">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
