Just like high fantasy, grimdark, cyberpunk, many historical periods, etc. Not all settings work equally well for all genres. Space Opera is great for 4X, difficult for Grand Strategy, and Stellaris does a pretty darn good job at being what it is, imo, by using 4X elements to address aspects where it is a difficult setting for Grand Strategy. Your mileage may vary. But for me that&rsquo;s one of the main reasons I enjoy it, and I have difficulty getting hooked by Space Opera 4X in general.</p><p>Star Citizen is a weird setting which is a little bit Space Opera and very much &ldquo;WW2-sci-fi&rdquo;. That is great for a story-based dogfighting game that doesn&rsquo;t care about physics and realism, but is about cool pewpews and hammy cinematics. But it&rsquo;s a terrible setting for a sandbox game, a decent one for a PvP game and a difficult choice for an PvE MMO. Star Citizen wants to be all of these and it absolutely doesn&rsquo;t work. Even if we disregard all the issues on the technical side, the choice of setting and game doesn&rsquo;t work. A PvE MMO needs a theme park and content-recyling mechanics. A PvP game needs a strong meta-game based on factions, rankings and/or player communities. Sandboxes need a mechanics supporting exploration, player-constructed content and emergent gameplay.</p><p>It&rsquo;s really difficult to make a space MMO that isn&rsquo;t total garbage, and it&rsquo;s probably going to be nich√© if it works. Like Eve and ED. I think that&rsquo;s why so many backers pin their hopes on subsumption being SkyNet, procedural content somehow not being repetitive and &ldquo;pipelines&rdquo;. Because what they want isn&rsquo;t actually possible with current technology.</p><p>They want West World or the Holo Deck. But procedural content gives you NMS, Dwarf Fortress and ED. Current AI technology gives you uh‚Ä¶ DOTA bots? Black &amp; White AI was overhyped. Radiant AI was overhyped. &ldquo;Pipelines&rdquo; give you the amount of content in AAA games. Attempting accurate simulation of physics at an object-level in a space MMO as anything but fancy local VFX gives you either Glitchy Lag Simulator or Go-Broke-In-The-Cloud Simulator.</p><p>Seeing the constant chants of &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand game development&rdquo; irks me to no end, because backing the Star Citizen project is based on fundamentally not understanding what is technologically possible, let alone what is possible with fricking CryEngine/LumberYard (which can be used to make awesome games, but not to secure the Turing Award) - because where Molyneux used dreams as a marketing tool, the open development of Star Citizen leaves no doubts about CIG constantly trying to do what the technical foundations absolutely do not support. This isn&rsquo;t about alpha or development cycles. The problem isn&rsquo;t the glitches, bugs, or missing content. That&rsquo;s just development hell, and good games can emerge from that. The problem is the stupid idea that there is some magic technology underneath it all, and that&rsquo;s going to save the day. And that&rsquo;s where CIG should be honest and squash those insane expectations. But I guess that would kill the project faster than any space court.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/pa.gif alt="AP's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/UR6enzm.jpg></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/5KlfCZ5.jpg></figure></blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>Honestly, I&rsquo;d rather see the grief now when CiG can work out solutions to mitigate it, than once the game goes live.

The numbers, which are self-reported and do not include returns, aren‚Äôt even close.</p><p>Chris Roberts‚Äô collection of spacefaring games raised $34.91 million in 2017, down slightly from $36.11 million in 2016. Meanwhile, successful Kickstarters for video games overall remained relatively flat in 2017, with $17.25 million raised, down from around $17.6 million the year before.</p><p><strong>That means the Star Citizen project has raised more than double the amount of every other game project on Kickstarter ‚Äî more than 700 in all ‚Äî for two years in a row.</strong></p><p><strong>However, the data set is complicated by several significant factors. First, CIG/RSI refused to report how much money they‚Äôve returned to backers.</strong> Several significant returns are currently being contested, including one in excess of $25,000. It‚Äôs therefore impossible to know how large a proportion of its funding CIG/RSI have been forced to refund.</p><p>Additionally, Kickstarter said that of all the money pledged to video game projects in 2016, 85 to 88 percent of it went to successful campaigns.
