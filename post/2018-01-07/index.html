And it had already been around for some time when I read about it, because it wasn’t new material you had to scour just-published papers for, it was in the class textbook.</p><p>Subsumption AI research was about building swarms of individually-stupid micro-robots that would collaborate to accomplish some slightly complex task by mimicing a computer scientist’s understanding of how individual ants work together in an ant colony. Each ant-bot was programmed with a set of several primitive, simple behaviors. The idea is that only one of those canned behaviors gets to control the bot at a time; selection of the active behavior loop was determined by sensory feedback and comm messages from other nearby bots. Inactive behaviors are ‘subsumed’ beneath the active one, hence the name.</p><p>They used this concept to successfully do things vaguely similar to an ant colony. Let the worker bots roam free in a little environment, and some of them would fall into gathering behaviors to move “food” (crumpled up balls of aluminum foil) to a staging area while others settled into moving it from the staging area into the “nest” for storage. Stuff like that.</p><p>The theme was trying to make simple individual rules create more complex, emergent herd behavior, and it was all MIT Media Lab as fuck, that being the lab which invented it. For those not in the know, MIT’s Media Lab is an academic compsci research lab which gets a disproportionate amount of publicity and funding due to a combo of friends in very high places and a focus on doing wacky, press friendly things.</p><p>So that’s the revolutionary AI tech which is going to make SC NPCs behave in a super fidelitous lifelike fashion: something invented a quarter century ago as a crude way of emulating ant brains. But not real ant brains, ant brains as understood by a bunch of compsci grad students and/or profs whose grasp of insect behavior was probably poor. And (so far as I can tell) this super advanced thing has not seen much use outside of pie in the sky academic research, because most real world robots are automated welders and CNC milling machines which just need to mindlessly repeat a control program over and over.</p><p>On that last point, don’t get me wrong. It’s cool and good to spend a little bit of society’s wealth on goofy stuff that has no immediate use irl, and you are always going to have to accept that some of it won’t have any use ever because it’s tricky to figure out which is which ahead of time. It’s just - lol no, cultists, subsumption is not gonna make the game good (or a game). It’s not the right way to make NPCs behave like people, or in a way that is fun to interact with.</p><p>It’s also easy to guess how this idea became a big thing at CIG. Junior grade AI programmer is told to figure out how to make lifelike NPCs, finds this One Weird Trick that seems to make cool stuff happen out of extremely simple base rules, doesn’t realize that maybe it’s not quite so easy to make it generate convincing human behavior or that those apparently simple rules may have needed a ton of tweaking to get right, sells it to Chris, and pretty soon it’s on the list of gee whiz material used to milk whales.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/TheAgent.jpg alt="TheAgent's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=//www.youtube.com/embed/2aokaaWeRjc style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><strong>(video: Old wingman&rsquo;s hangar visits Moon Collider, talks about AI, 2014)</strong></p><p>This old video does a fairly good job at showcasing just how long CIG has been spinning these plates.</p></blockquote><p>I love how CIG has seriously fuckin burned every single motherfucking company they worked with from 2013 to 2016</p><p>every single fuckin one</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/qgOK42V.png></figure></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/pa.gif alt="AP's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/215225889?t=04h13m48s">https://www.twitch.tv/videos/215225889?t=04h13m48s</a> <strong>(video: CryTek_Legal_Team follows twitch streamer)</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/peter_gabriel.gif alt="peter gabriel's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>The name of the CIG&rsquo;s law firm is [POTATO]</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=https://puu.sh/yUjL9/7e47d2b227.jpg alt=https://puu.sh/yUjL9/7e47d2b227.jpg></figure><p>haha what is that even supposed to mean.</p><p>Oh jeez Chris at the end you really gotta pick a look and stick with it man.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>so star citizen, the &lsquo;game&rsquo; that exists, is a bunch of assets poorly imported into the demo crytek made 5 years ago right?</p><p>every time i find something out about how they make the game it amazes me. just all the travails they&rsquo;ve had with getting single ships to not lag the servers out. it&rsquo;s crazy. they make design and coding mistakes that like, amateur modders don&rsquo;t make in other games.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><video width=100% height=100% controls><source src=https://i.imgur.com/s6dNobO.mp4 type=video/mp4></video><p>if the crobblers made the matrix</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>I was wondering what Chinese gamers think about Star Citizen so I found quite a popular &ldquo;ask&rdquo; thread with someone wondering how people view the game.

As we discussed before the holidays, we now have a delivery schedule based on dates rather than features.</p><p>We are doing this for several reasons. First, thanks to the huge improvements to core tech, we can be more predictable about delivering our patches, as we are building upon and refining existing tech. Second, we want to get more build iteration, which gives us more opportunities to get feedback from the community going forward. Finally, this new approach provides more flexibility in our development. If a proposed feature takes longer than anticipated, we will push it to the next release, rather than delaying other new content.</p><p>We plan on delivering new builds once a quarter, starting with our first drop at the end of March. After that, we aim to deliver again at the end of June, September, and December of this year.</p><p>Our first release will pull together all the great work that was completed last year with a focus on optimizing the server and client. We also intend to include one or two new features which will enhance gameplay around Crusader.</p><p>3.1 is about enhancing performance and polishing the gameplay systems and UI, including ships, system traversal, a large balance pass of our economy, and improving AI for spaceflight and combat. All the great data and feedback from the community over the holiday period is really going to help us with these tasks.</p><p>Although 3.1 is our focus for late March, several teams will also be working on our long-term goals for this year, in which we plan to deliver the vast majority of systems and mechanics so players have a variety of options to lose themselves in the ‘Verse.</p><p>For our end-of-June release, we plan to implement the initial tier 0 versions of mining, salvaging, mobile refueling, and repair into the game, as well as give the player the ability to create their own missions like hiring mercs, transport, or refueling missions. On the AI side, we plan to improve both ship and FPS AI for both missions as well as general activity on space and planetary bases.</p><p>Our next delivery in late September will introduce another major long-term tech goal: Object Container Streaming. This technology will allow us to start expanding the Stanton system with additional destinations, while managing our memory usage much better. In this delivery, we would also like to start introducing the mechanics of how you stake and file land claims and the gameplay that comes with this feature. This release will also continue to consolidate and polish all the new features in the past milestone.</p><p>That will leave our final build of the year in late December. Now that our streaming tech has been tested and can support the huge amount of new data content introduced(), we will continue to expand the Stanton System, allowing players to explore, fulfill their career choices, and do many different types of missions, either with friends or on their own.</p><p>Stay tuned as the new Star Citizen Production Roadmap will come online along with the new RSI website later this month, with more development and release details.</p><p>See you in the ‘Verse (literally),</p><p>— The Star Citizen Team</p><p>In the meantime, head over to the launcher page and download the 3.0.0 patch to see the universe for yourself.
