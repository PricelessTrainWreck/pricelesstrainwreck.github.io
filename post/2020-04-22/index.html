(<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitize...ang_starter_kit>https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitize...ang_starter_kit</a>) I won! It was such a cool feeling. The Giveaways OP send me an personal message and say something like: he just want to quit SC forever and will also gift me his Carrack and Cutlass Red too&rdquo;. So i telled him to send the original Starter Pack from the Giveaway to my friend (as a surprise) and send me the Carrack + Cutlass Red.</p><p>After a few seconds ~ voila I f*** got a Carrack and a Cutlass Red! I screamed my lung out. I started to melt this stuff and buy me the subscriber 890J. I just was the luckiest guy in the world.</p><p>Now the bad thing&hellip; On the 21th of January i got an Mail from CIG. My Account got temporary closed. Due to suspicious gift activity. I thought: &ldquo;Ok. Maybe its just a check up. Because the worth of gifting was to big!&rdquo; I instantly respond to the Mail from CIG, because they write to send them stuff to help for investigate the thing etc.</p><p>I send them Screenshots, Names, Dates, What happened and the original link from the Reddit Giveaway.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Till now - no answer, no information, nothing.</p><p>Why i&rsquo;am so mentaly broke you ask?</p><p>I am a student here in germany and i have like NO Money. I live in Berlin where the rental for my flat is huge!</p><p>Two things are bad and destroy myself&hellip;</p><p>First: Many of the german community member can confirm you all, that i spare alot of money. I just wanted so bad to buy the Constellation Phoenix because i&rsquo;m in love with this beauty! I put back needs like food till i managed to buy it on the last CitCon. And i was the happiest guy on earth.</p><p>I am scared that this is gone.</p><p>Second: I am a long time subscriber and during the deactivation/ban of my Account, CIG is charging my Bankaccount still with the amount of the normal subscription. I dont know what to do. I cant cancel my subscription, because i cant loggin. I worked as an IT costumer support and know what a pain in the ass it is, when i charge the money back. And yeah&hellip; At least i dont want to charge it back&hellip; Because my hopes are high, to evantually get my Account back.</p><p>So please&hellip; Spread this.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Scruffpuff.jpg alt="Scruffpuff's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>The product is constantly changing, based on the timeline of Chris failing to do something.
