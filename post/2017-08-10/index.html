Aside from showing off awesome cockpit animations, bells and whistles, ship ladder animations, cockpit startup animations, all which lend zero to actual gameplay, We don&rsquo;t know or have not been shown actual in-game value of these ships, value in terms of actual combat capability, trading capability, and even stealth capabilities.

Chris Roberts paid several A-List Hollywood actors millions of dollars to get on camera next to his unfortunate wife, and paid tens of millions of dollars for motion capture before they had a functioning game engine and before they knew if they could use any of it.</p><p>He spent millions more creating, throwing away, recreating, re-throwing away, and creating yet again several spaceship assets before he had a functioning game engine, and with no consideration as to whether or not those assets would work with each other, the engine, or the aforementioned motion capture. Spoiler: it didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>He also spend untold millions of dollars building 4 studios around the world, because successful game development studios have that. The fact that real publishers earned them over time by actually creating and releasing games is lost on him.</p><p>They also spent millions of dollars creating a real-life Truman Show analogue consisting of constant video feeds, &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo;, &ldquo;lore&rdquo;, fake world assets, and thousands of hours of complete bullshit video intended to make it look like they&rsquo;re making progress on a &ldquo;game.&rdquo;</p><p>What Chris did not do - what nobody in CIG has ever done - is decide what Star Citizen is. Nobody has created a game design, nobody has proposed a core game loop, nobody has considered even one single moment of gameplay or how any of this will work. It&rsquo;s just Chris Roberts continuing to exist as the genetic error he was born as. Stupidity is expensive.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/TheAgent.jpg alt="The Titanic's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>Now when he was inventing render to technology for his holograms, it&rsquo;s very critical to understand that this is video games.</p><p>If you want a hologram, you clone your model and give it a snazzy &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hologram!&rdquo; Shader so it looks super cool.</p><p>Easy to use anywhere? Heck yes! Just add your &ldquo;hologram-guy.character&rdquo; to your scene.</p><p>Development time? You&rsquo;ve already got the model, just build the shader and textures for it. Maybe what, 2 weeks to make it look like something straight out of a Hollywood movie?</p><p>Difficulty in implementation? Equally as difficult as animating any other characters in your game. Shouldn&rsquo;t be hard hopefully if you&rsquo;ve got a handle on animation.</p><p>Hardware overhead? As much as a character plus that shader, shouldn&rsquo;t be enough to kill a scene where you want a hologram to be. Spawn holo guy in the player&rsquo;s room, then when done despawn it.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the logical way, because it&rsquo;s a video game, where &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist, only how you creatively do a thing.</p><p>Now compare this to CIGs version:</p><p>Easy to use anywhere? Need to set up an extra camera and extra entire area around the character in the scene. Basically, it can&rsquo;t be a spur of the moment thing since the scene will need to be built around it.</p><p>Development time? Probably between 8-20 months.</p><p>Difficulty in implementation? Each scene using a hologram will need the hologram character spawned in some special area other players can&rsquo;t find it, including an additional camera and linking. Every player using it will somehow need to not overlap wherever the hologram guy is at in the world. Will be complex to figure out in a multiplayer setting, and I have a feeling CIG hasn&rsquo;t gotten far enough to figure out how this is actually going to work.</p><p>Hardware overhead? Entire character and additional scene needs to be rendered on screen, then rendered again to a texture. A single scene will need at least 3 times the amount of work per frame to render, more depending on how shaders or scene filters are implemented.</p><p>Overall CIG spent tons of effort to overcomplicate something that will not add anything that cloning a character in a location would have done.</p><p>I guess the only real added benefit is instead of just getting &ldquo;a character&rdquo; hologram you can also see the surroundings of that character too since it&rsquo;s a scene with another camera. But that may make the hologram not stand out and look busy, so it they may end up turning off the background scene, effectively wiping out the only real &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;.</p><p>Also it will probably help to kill your frame rate, which for Star Citizen is kind of an expected feature at this point for everything they do.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/TheAgent.jpg alt="TheAgent's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>This is what happens when you outsource big portions of a massive project.

They&rsquo;ll change the narrative to make us focus on something else (like Squadron 42, which had a release date of 2015. Then 2016. Now ?). A handful of SC white-knights will attack anyone who questions the new narrative. They will talk in the present-tense about features that don&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s a cycle I&rsquo;ve been observing for years. I want Star Citizen to succeed, I really do.
