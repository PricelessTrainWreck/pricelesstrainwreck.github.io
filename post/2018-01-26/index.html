What that basically equates to is: can you move the model around the map. The flight model is still not technically functional. I know there is some debate, but take a look at the .gif a few pages back with the ship jittering around nose-down on the planet. Take a look at literally any video of SC ships in action. Play the game. The ships - none of them - are attached to a space game flight model. There is no mass, inertia, thrust, or anything that gives each ship heft and a unique feel. So to say the ship is &ldquo;flyable&rdquo; is making the game look much farther along than it really is. In a sense, <em>none</em> of the ships are flyable until they put in a flight model.</p><p>If the &ldquo;flight model&rdquo; in the game now is what they&rsquo;re keeping, then fucking <img src=/img/emotes/lol.gif alt="lol emote" class=sa-emote> - no amount of &ldquo;tweaking&rdquo; will fix it. This game is a model viewer at best.</p><p>2) Just an extension of #1 - the chart farthest to the right mentions game mechanics, and space combat is complete. Without a flight model, is it really space combat?</p><p>So I think your chart is actually exceptionally generous and doesn&rsquo;t actually reflect the true state of CIG&rsquo;s progress, which is essentially none.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the hardest thing to explain about this game to the uninitiated - even the parts that are there aren&rsquo;t there.

and say, &lsquo;Hey, you know, I will give you a CUT of this&rsquo;, and&hellip; right now&hellip; we know you can&rsquo;t do that&hellip; the plan is&hellip; is to be part of the SERVICE BEACON design, whether or not that is the&hellip; the first TIER that ROLLS OUT, <strong>that&rsquo;s… that&rsquo;s&hellip; something that, um, basically Tony and I are still discussing.</strong></p><p><strong>Q:</strong></p><p>What about plans for a traditional MMO trade window?</p><p><strong>Todd Papy:</strong></p><p>The… the&hellip; that is basically be a MOBIGLASS, that is&hellip; that is kinda SERVICE BEACON DESIGN of you know, hey, with the MOBIGLASS this is how I, um&hellip; basically, ah&hellip; create CONTRACTS, so on and so forth, we call it a SERVICE BEACON but it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s part of the MOBIGLASS and&hellip; and how that would work were, um&hellip; it&rsquo;s PLAYER INITIATED CONTRACTS so if you, um&hellip; are a HAULER and you want to hire a bunch of MERCHS or you&rsquo;re a PIRATE and you wanna be able to PAY&hellip; you know&hellip; basically people for a day&rsquo;s work&hellip; <strong>you know, that&rsquo;s… that&rsquo;s what will&hellip; we&rsquo;ll be WORKING TOWARDS</strong></p><p><strong>Q:</strong></p><p>Will we see hotfixes between 3.0 and 3.1 and 3.2?</p><p><strong>Jeffrey Pease (DevOps Engineer):</strong></p><p>Ok, ah… to answer that question probably the first thing we need to do is establish what we consider a hotfix because different software companies and even different videogame companies have different definitions for what a hotfix is.</p><p>For CIG typically we consider the term HOTFIX to be for something we apply to an ENVIRONMENT that&rsquo;s already been DEPLOYED&hellip; but where the fix isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s normally included&hellip; that&hellip; for the build that environment&rsquo;s hosting&hellip; so like in a worst case scenario if&hellip; if we were to RE-DEPLOY the exact same CHANGELIST that our backers can see in the LAUNCHER for the version of the game, those fixes wouldn&rsquo;t be included for a re-deployed version of that game because they were added after the fact&hellip;</p><p>What this tends to mean is that&hellip; the fixes can go into the game without players actually noticing that they&rsquo;ve been added UNLESS we specifically tell them&hellip; ah, to answer the question as to whether we will SEE any hotfixes&hellip; the plain fact is that we have already hotfixed a number of problems that were encountered over the holiday break, Ahmed and Bryce as well as Tony and some of our other engineers and programmers were looking into several issues that&hellip; were happening with&hellip; the DIFFUSION GATEWAY and&hellip; our SHOPPING SYSTEM and&hellip; the PROBABILITY VOLUME SERVICE because we had a bunch of problems where&hellip; gameservers weren&rsquo;t recovering their ability to list items in the SHOPS&hellip; we had a bu&hellip; a problem where&hellip; the PROBABILITY VOLUME SERVICE was spawning a mission that was causing the gameservers to deadlock, uh&hellip;</p><p><strong>We had… a really strange issue where the gameservers were causing the SHIPS to become PARENTS and CHILDREN of OTHER SHIPS which caused the CIRCULAR REFERENCE&hellip; and then when the CACHE tried to clear the data, because it was a circular reference, the cache would DEADLOCK because it was just keep going ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND and uh&hellip;</strong></p><p>And then… uh&hellip; another one that actually&hellip; some of the hotfixes for the PERSISTENCE CACHE that we did were to put in additional LOGGING so that we could figure out what was causing it to deadlock and then TOM SAWYER ended up figuring out that the deadlock was being caused by that CYCLICAL REFERENCE and then we also did a hotfix to the GENERAL INSTANCE MANAGER because I discovered that it was trying to matchmake people into matches&hellip; that weren&rsquo;t supposed to let people in once they&rsquo;d already started&hellip; so for example for VANDUUL SWARM and um&hellip; PIRATE SWARM and&hellip; RACE MODES&hellip; once the game would START, people can&rsquo;t join, but it was trying to put them IN and it was telling them, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t join that because it&rsquo;s already started&rsquo;, so another one of the hotfixes we put in was to make it so that the GIM would stop doing that&hellip;</p><p>And uh&hellip; we also have&hellip; this&hellip; new FEATURE&hellip; for 3.0&hellip; for the BACKEND SERVICES where we&hellip; have&hellip; a DEDICATED PROCESS that will take all of the items that people have purchased on our PLATFORM&hellip; and&hellip; add them to their ACCOUNT in game&hellip; originally the servers that would do that would be the same servers players were ON and if one of those servers CRASHED it would cause problems with items being missing and stuff</p><p>So now we have a dedicated process for THAT&hellip; that&hellip; because it&rsquo;s not shared with instances that players are playing on we don&rsquo;t have to worry about it crashing in the middle of someone getting the items into their account&hellip; one of the GIM hotfixes that we added was to exclude those specific processes from the ROLLING RESTARTS THAT WE DO TO THE GAMESERVERS&hellip; uh, I think that covered most if not all of the hotfixes that we did.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong></p><p>What is the plan for our Freelancer variants?</p><p><strong>Kirk Tome (Lead Tech Designer):</strong></p><p>Ah, the FREELANCER, ahm… OK well, uh&hellip; it&hellip; it IS one of the original five ships for Star Citizen that were planned, um&hellip; and we do know that backers are waiting for them, uh&hellip; ah&hellip; for the&hellip; for them&hellip; so for that we do apologize&hellip; uhm&hellip; I do know that <strong>they are scheduled to BEGIN WORK, uh, in the LATTER HALF OF THE YEAR</strong>, um.. by the… uh&hellip; UK TEAM, um&hellip; this&hellip; um&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t, uh, GUARANTEE that they&rsquo;ll be DONE by&hellip; by the end of the year but&hellip; uh&hellip; we are STRIVING to make that happen&hellip; um&hellip; and&hellip; um&hellip; we do&hellip; we do know how much the um&hellip; the ah&hellip; the (mumble mumble mumble) so we&hellip; we ARE working on them and we, ah&hellip; DO (mumble) to get them STARTED&hellip; and we&rsquo;ll TRY to get them COMPLETED um&hellip;</p><p>Unfortunately as you know um&hellip; we do have a lot of ships that we&rsquo;re uh&hellip; MAKING and a lot of FEATURES that need to go in the game that also require artists and design and engineering work, so&hellip; things do get pushed back but um&hellip; but they&rsquo;re on the SCHEDULE so uh&hellip; we&rsquo;ll&hellip; we&rsquo;ll&hellip; TRY to get them OUT, ah&hellip; by&hellip; by the end of this year</p><p>Um&hellip; also uh&hellip; something that in OTHER NEWS the 300 SERIES rework uh, is also on the schedule for this year and uh, that will be done by the team in LA so um&hellip; we&rsquo;ll um&hellip; we&rsquo;ll be working on it here locally</p><p><strong>Q:</strong></p><p>Is the current way we spawn ships and vehicles in game the FINAL implementation? IE, using a terminal and popping them in?</p><p><strong>Luke Pressley (Lead Designer):</strong></p><p>Um, there are definitely further plans for development, ehrm… So, the TERMINAL probably, like&hellip; the notion of going to a TERMINAL probably won&rsquo;t change, eh&hellip; ehm&hellip; the TERMINAL will definitely change, the UI on there will get major improvements&hellip; ehm&hellip; and the kind of FLOW of it&hellip; but&hellip; as for like POPPING IN AND OUT? I guess the reason you&rsquo;re seeing so much popping in and out is because places like OLISAR and GRIMHEX&hellip; ah&hellip; it only has landing pads right now it doesn&rsquo;t have the HANGARS&hellip; Erm&hellip; URH!</p><p>You see these things pop in and out on these landing pads it SHOULD be a hangar.</p><p>It&hellip; wuh&hellip; lak&hellip; eh OLISAR is like a LEGACY kind of thing we just build on and build on until <strong>we finally get like the TRUCK STOP and uh, you know, we&rsquo;ll get a… a FINAL HOTEL</strong> eventually and it&rsquo;ll have some HANGARS and that means that all of this popping in and out will happen AWAY from the player, you know, he won&rsquo;t be able to go in that hangar before he has access to the ship and then he&rsquo;ll be granted access to the hangar and he&rsquo;ll go in… now, that&rsquo;s not to say that we can ever completely get rid of popping in and out, ehm&hellip;</p><p>I mean for instance when a player logs out, you know, his ship hangs around for an amount of time and then it has to go somewhere, ehm&hellip; and then a player logging in, I mean obviously that ship has to come in&hellip; some&hellip; I mean&hellip; where he parked it before, if he left it, up&hellip; you know&hellip; on his&hellip; um&hellip; NOT STORED</p><p>So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll get rid of it entirely, we are a game after all, but&hellip; we, you know&hellip; you won&rsquo;t be seeing them popping in and out on the landing pads as often as you do now.</p><p><strong>OLISAR is a MONSTROSITY</strong>, I mean, you&rsquo;re about to see something that&rsquo;s about to get even WORSE because you know, the RECLAIMER is HUGE, it&rsquo;s… it&rsquo;s almost the size of the IDRIS and&hellip; eh&hellip; that&rsquo;s coming soon, so we&rsquo;ve had to just&hellip; the LARGE landing pad that is already like a football field is now gonna be like two football fields on there&hellip;</p><p><strong>So I mean it&rsquo;s good because we don&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t WASTE like final art</strong> or anything like that, we just, you know EXPAND UPON this thing until we&rsquo;ve got… until we KNOW all the things that it needs to do, ehm&hellip; and then&hellip; and once we&rsquo;ve got that we can build this thing PROPERLY, knowing all the pieces</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m shocked, apparently the ability to buy ships with game credits won&rsquo;t make 3.1</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/G0RF.gif alt="G0RF's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://youtu.be/fJcfJOj1-a8?t=1m39s">SPOILER THAT SURPRISING NEWS:</a>

He didn’t have the skills to even build himself a baby demo to show off. He relied on the shoulders of CryTek to make his dream come true. But he lied about it all. Even showed videos of himself “programming”, had his wife talk about his late night power coding sprees (while she herself not joking talked about her multiple degrees, hilarious marine biology and shoes and marketing stories the likes of which were hugely unbelievable).</p><p>So, there you go.
