CIG was to use CryEngine branding on the first loading screens.</strong></p><p>Take: This one is largely open and shut. CIG did not.</p><p><strong>4. CIG was to send bugfixes to Crytek.</strong></p><p>Take: Again, largely open and shut, with Crytek a paper trail of CIG not returning code on request.

I&rsquo;m going to comment on the drafting.</p><p>The way that document is written says an awful lot about CIG&rsquo;s priorities. I feel for the lawyers who had to write it, because I&rsquo;d bet money they had Chris and Ortwin leaning over their shoulders demanding stuff as they drew it up. Statements of case are supposed to be calm and clear summaries of a party&rsquo;s position; this one rages about those big CryTek meanies and how crap their arguments are. I&rsquo;ve worked for egomaniacs and I recognise the signs. We&rsquo;ve got:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> A lengthy rant at the start about how mean CryTek are and how they tell filthy filthy lies. This doesn&rsquo;t actually win points with judges (maybe juries, but even then…). The court&rsquo;s got a dozen files to get through today, they don&rsquo;t appreciate having to wade through your detailed allegations about what grade of cock the Plaintiff gargles.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> A decidedly aggressive tone in the first few pages, i.e. the ones an <em>investor or backer</em> are most likely to read. This is the real &ldquo;fire and fury&rdquo;, a ferocious defence that plays to the crowd and reassures them that their money is safe. Obviously CIG would like to see their motion to dismiss succeed, but it&rsquo;s rather akin to the injunction Skadden opened with; a furious counterattack to show how big their law-peen is.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> A fanatical need, in the first few pages, to state that CryTek&rsquo;s statements are false. Okay, we get it, why <em>every time</em> you use the word &ldquo;statement&rdquo;? Because someone was breathing down the drafter&rsquo;s neck about how incredibly evil CryTek are and demanding that they put in how all their statements are filthy lies. I wonder if Chris is the kind of client who demands personal signoff on case papers?</p><p>Matters then calm down for a while, probably because Chris didn&rsquo;t read that far and because FFKS actually need to set out the technical details of their case, but then we start up again with….</p><p><strong>4.</strong> An _<strong>entire section</strong> devoted to saying how wonderful and blameless Ortwin is, and how his reputation is irrevocably harmed by nasty things said about him on websites.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t even relevant to the defence anymore. Presumably it was drawn up in response to the earlier allegation and then left in on Ortwin&rsquo;s orders so there was a public statement refuting the mean things Skadden said about him (and his peon, who gets namechecked once). That tells me all I need to know about Ortwin.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> CIG&rsquo;s egomaniac executives are bleeding through onto the page. It hasn&rsquo;t compromised anything yet, but this would provoke some eyerolls in most courts. They&rsquo;re still playing to the crowd, which is an understandable and rational response but does leave open all the comedy meltdown options this thread dreams of.</p><blockquote><p>one of CIG&rsquo;s lawyers:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who else is frustrated by the lack of GIFs and emojis in Outlook?

The contract isn’t as strongly in favor of Crytek’s argument as the petition indicated, which is why I wanted to actually see it.</p><p>Overall, it’s a poorly written contract (sorry, Ortwin), so the fight is probably going to go on. Which is typical, because transactional lawyers aren’t all that good at writing contracts. Litigators are way better at tearing them apart.</p><p>The whole argument about RSI not being a party to the contract is perfectly valid, and why you have separate companies. A separate legal entity can’t breach a contract it&rsquo;s not a party to, so Crytek is going to have to jump through more hoops than it has so far.</p><p>Despite having some valid legal points, this is still a badly written motion. Judges don’t appreciate bombastic personal attacks, and CIG did themselves no favors there. Like claiming that Crytek was trying to mislead the court by not filing a copy of the contract, when there’s no need to attack evidence to a petition. They also managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory with the Ortwin discussion. They couldn’t just take their minor win of talking to Crytek and having the Ortwin allegations dropped from the petition, which Crytek took the high road and did. No, they had to continue to complain about allegations not in the live petition, which just makes CIG look like assholes.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>So no one gets to use cryengine do develop games (or space games) while SC is in development?

That line shouldn&rsquo;t even exist in the first place in that case, since it&rsquo;s standard copyright protection to say that nobody else can do anything with the product you own.</p><p>So I&rsquo;m at a loss, I&rsquo;m not sure which one they&rsquo;re arguing, both make no sense to me.

This isn&rsquo;t going to work because the sentence plainly carves out intentional conduct, and they&rsquo;re stuck with the words of the contract. Plus, the idea that you can put something in your contract saying you can breach the contract with impunity is laughable, and a judge would bend over backwards to come up with any reading other than that.</p><p>The second sentence only limits Crytek&rsquo;s liability to $1.85million; it does nothing for CIG. It&rsquo;s also badly written, because it removes that cap for gross negligence and says nothing about intentional, despite intentional being a higher level of misconduct. It&rsquo;s also redundant, because the first sentence should limit it to $0 anyway, but maybe it&rsquo;s just being extra careful.</p><p>It&rsquo;s possible the first sentence is supposed to apply to all damages other than actual damages, in which case it all makes more sense, but it doesn&rsquo;t say that.

The &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; parts are poorly written, but generally exclusive is used with other wording to give a license which cannot be freely sub-licensed, which cannot be transferred, which does not prevent usage of other engines/middleware/libraries, and which does not prevent the licensor from licensing to other parties. So CIG and CryTek both are trying to have the poorly written contract mean something very different than the original intent and what is normal in licensing.

Grant of License</strong></p><p><strong>2.1.</strong> Grant: Subject to strict and continuous compliance with the restrictions in the Agreement and the timely pament of the first installment of the License and Buyout Fee pursuant to Section 5.1.1 hereof by Licensee, CryTek grants to Licensee a world-wide, license only:</p><p><strong>2.1.1.</strong> to non-exclusively develop, support, maintain, extend and/or enhance CryEnging such right being non-sub-licensable except as set forth in Sec. 2.6 below;</p><p><strong>2.1.2.</strong> to exclusively embed CryEngine in the Game and develop the Game which right shall be sub-licensable pursuant to Sec. 2.6);_</p><p>If 2.1.2 is to be interpreted as CIG making a commitment to use CryEngine and only CryEngine to develop Star Citizen, why does the section say that CryTek &ldquo;grants to Licensee a world-wide, license&rdquo; to embed CryEngine in the game? If you commit to doing something in a contract, usually you wouldn&rsquo;t say that you&rsquo;ve been granted a license to do it. Usually a license is a permission to do something. A contractual commitment would usually be called an obligation, or the contract would state that CIG must do X, not that they have a license to do it.</p><p>If 2.1.2 is to be interpreted as CIG receiving an exclusive license to use CryEngine, meaning that no one else can use it, why does it say that CIG gets the license to &ldquo;exclusively embed CryEngine in the Game&rdquo;? CIG gets exclusive rights to the engine, but it&rsquo;s restricted to this one game? What does &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; even mean, then? Who is being excluded from working on Star Citizen? CryTek doesn&rsquo;t even have the right to grant people the right to work on Star Citizen, since that&rsquo;s CIG&rsquo;s IP. This is also a weird interpretation.</p><p>I wonder if the section was actually <em>intended</em> to mean something like this:</p><p><em>&ldquo;CryTek grants to CIG a license to embed CryEngine in Star Citizen. This license does not allow CIG to use CryEngine for any other games (it is <strong>exclusively</strong> for Star Citizen).&rdquo;</em></p><p>That would make more a lot more sense than either CryTek&rsquo;s or CIG&rsquo;s interpretations - that it&rsquo;s a license for one game only rather than an exclusive license for CryEngine, and that it&rsquo;s not an obligation to use CryEngine no matter what (which would be very odd for what is described as a &ldquo;license&rdquo;). That is not what the license says, though, so we&rsquo;re stuck with the confusing license agreement as it stands.</p><p>One thing I&rsquo;m seeing a lot is &ldquo;lol, why would CryTek give CIG an exclusive license to the CryEngine? That doesn&rsquo;t fit with their business model, that would be a terrible deal for them! Clearly that&rsquo;s a silly interpretation&rdquo;. I have never been involved in contract disputes like that, but I&rsquo;m not sure &ldquo;this is a really bad deal, so that can&rsquo;t be the interpretation&rdquo; works as a legal argument. The license agreement between CryTek and CIG involves CIG paying millions of dollars for a license to use the CryEngine. If I were someone completely unaware of Star Citizen and I read this agreement without any context, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d immediately interpret it the way CryTek does. I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t feel totally confident having to convince a judge and a jury that the exclusivity clause should be interpreted the way CryTek wants it to be interpreted.</p><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I don&rsquo;t think the dispute over the meaning of an exclusive license is a slam dunk for CryTek/Skadden.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Spent most of the night reading the GLA, skimming the thread and reading Derek&rsquo;s stuff here - <a href=https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/949626014367469568.html>https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/949626014367469568.html</a></p><p>I have to throw my hands up and say that imo Derek is right on all points:</p><p>1. There is no argument that it&rsquo;s an exclusive license. Whether that is determined to be unfair or unenforceable is entirely up to space court. However the money that CIG agreed to pay Crytek is based on the license terms and that&rsquo;s a pretty substantial one - without exclusivity the license fee would have been much, much higher. In other words, &ldquo;use our engine and no one else&rsquo;s and we&rsquo;ll give you a great deal&rdquo;</p><p>2. SQ42 is defined as a feature of SC. The license does not allow CIG to sell SQ42 as a separate game which they did. There&rsquo;s no getting around that.</p><p>3. Amendment to Section 2.1 allows modification to the engine by third parties (not exclusively CIG) as long as it&rsquo;s for the development of SC, ie &ldquo;being exclusive only with respect to the game&rdquo;. Essentially meaning that third party contractors can modify Cry code without being in breach of the license. I only mention this one as I&rsquo;ve seen discussion around it.</p><p>4. A press release does not release CIG from the terms of the GLA. I am absolutely dumbfounded that this is CIG&rsquo;s response and that they filed it into a court. Absolutely dumbfounded. There is nothing in the GLA that releases CIG from that contract and CIG have not filed anything to show they negotiated a change to the GLA or had it terminated.</p><p>7. If Cryengine had been modified so much that it was considered by CIG to be &lsquo;StarEngine&rsquo;, tough titties, Crytek own all those modifications and are free to fold them back into Cry.</p><p>8. Switching engine to Lumbaryard is a black and white breach of the contract unless the exclusivity of the GLA is determined to be unfair - HOWEVER! If there was a case to be made for it being unfair CIG could have released themselves from the GLA on that basis before the engine switch. They didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Derek is also pointing out that Crytek selling CIG the royalty license meant that they missed out on a percentage of the $180 million in fundraising, but that&rsquo;s how the royalty game rolls Derek you should know that ;)</p><p>I&rsquo;m not getting where people are coming from when they are saying the GLA is poorly written or open to interpretation, to me it&rsquo;s clear and explicit and the amendments are clear and explicit. If anything wasn&rsquo;t clear and explicit it would be amended and edited until it was and then it gets signed. The license that CIG have for Cryengine is for the development of Star Citizen and nothing else, and if they switch engine they are in breach of the contract on its face. If they want to go down that road and argue that this is an unfair term then:</p><p>1. It is a CRITICAL term for valuing the $ amount of the license</p><p>2. CIG were free to have it amended at any time in the last 5 years and pony up a space dollah amount to Crytek</p><p>3. They went ahead and switched engine and put out a press release saying so WITHOUT a legal determination on the unfairness of this term or anything in writing to Crytek saying it was unfair - because if they did it would be part of their filing right now</p><p>If you cannot see how fucking totally ludicrous this motion to dismiss is then you simply don&rsquo;t comprehend the english language and I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you. It will actually be torn up on day one. I&rsquo;m leaning toward Loxbourne&rsquo;s opinion of this being a complete PR move by CIG to keep the shitizens happy being correct.</p><p>If CIG don&rsquo;t settle this madness 5 minutes before this goes into space court it means that they simply do not have the money to do so because they have fuck all else to make a case out of here.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Now both parties have filed their statements of case, we&rsquo;re firmly into the territory of &ldquo;will this argument fly with a court?&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s subjective and dependant entirely on the judge and jury&rsquo;s own reactions on the day. We can comment on the evidence, caselaw, etc (and I think there&rsquo;s plenty of scope for a good effortpost or three about the caselaw FFKS are citing on the meaning of &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo;), but we are <em>not</em> qualified to say which argument is likely to win. Even if we were, every lawyer&rsquo;s seen a totally bullshit argument unexpectedly work, or an ironclad one fail.</p><p>Absent something hilarious happening, <strong>the thread&rsquo;s best bet now is to watch, laugh as the citizens all suddenly become experts on the legal definitions of words, and sit tight until discovery.</strong> I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s going to be all kinds of lovely things to comment on if the case proceeds that far.</p></blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>So after 6 months of sheer hell ive finally just today managed to get a refund, and it&rsquo;s all thanks to you guys..
