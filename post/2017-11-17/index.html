By saying this, he demonstrated that he either didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about, or he was being dishonest. It was probably a combination of the two.</strong></p><p>Now, almost 3 years after that presentation, backers still haven&rsquo;t seen a mission demo of SQ42, and the MMO is in alpha with, I&rsquo;m guessing, another 1-2 years of alpha ahead of them. At this rate, I would be impressed if the first episode of SQ42 gets released by 2020, and the MMO gets released by 2023.</p></blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/reddit.gif alt="reddit emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>If Star Wars Battlefront 2 had Star Citizen&rsquo;s community self.starcitizen</p><p>&ldquo;Darth Vader being locked behind a paywall unlocked isn&rsquo;t pay to win.

Each new installment only adds another chapter to the epic tome “Why Chris Roberts is a terrible game developer, project manager and company leader.” If you lack the awareness to not be embarrassed with each new delay and lack the humility to not be ashamed, plant two other people in that chair who might and use you and Sandi’s time in ways more likely to help the project.

The advantages people paid for are so terrible that when everyone stops using them they will not be considered advantages anymore. It&rsquo;s funny but it&rsquo;s also complete speculation about a game that doesn&rsquo;t exist yet with mechanics that don&rsquo;t exist and interactions that haven&rsquo;t happened yet between ships that don&rsquo;t exist in an economy that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p><p>You can not say that Star Citizen has no Pay To Win in it because it is the exact definition of it. When you look at a raw exchange of in game assets and currency for money and try to speculate wild hypotheticals to show that there are instances where a player that paid money is not at an advantage over someone who didn&rsquo;t and redefine the definition of what &ldquo;Win&rdquo; means you are showing that you want it to not be pay to win, not that it isn&rsquo;t.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>G0RF</div><blockquote><p><em>“I don&rsquo;t think there is any other game that is trying to do as much as we&rsquo;re trying to do.

Sean went right on that show and delivered a complete fiction of the present game state with absolutely no hesitation whatsoever, just as his exemplar leader has done for years with bald-faced bullcrap like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaJx4TdshFA&amp;t=0m10s">this</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-3YBuFI3iI&amp;t=23m52s">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1GUDQuFb1A&amp;t=92m2s">this.</a></p><p><strong>Lies. Massive lies. Constant lies. And continuum of lying so persistent and inescapable it actually becomes immersive.</strong></p><p>Normalization of managerial deviance — and pathological public dishonesty is exactly that, CIG — is just as effectively achieved via their programming. The quote above from 10ftC delivered with benign confidence is itself an example of it. The message as delivered is, contrary to all the early bluster and constant mugging confidence, a concession of an anticipated failure to deliver on original scope promises all sugar-coated in Chris’s noxious entitlement. For though he has no plans to deliver what he originally pitched, he has expectations of perpetual subsidy from the chump army to get there, or partly there, or <em>somewhere</em> eventually.</p><p>And wherever he’s standing when the money finally runs out will be declared the destination. The journey itself — one of a portly goofball false prophet staggering, stumbling, gasping for breath, leading the exiles through the wilderness without map, compass, or North Star and spouting constant word of the Promised Land over yon horizon — will be declared their promised home and those still following may even believe it. Yet what Chris will no longer enjoy, and indeed what he has already lost, is control of his own narrative. The early years allowed him to project a narrative arc about himself, his game and his studio that was readily believed by most, even many goons, and his claims were repeated breathlessly as fact by the supplicant gaming press eager to amplify hype for the easy clicks.</p><p>Those days are long since behind us and they aren’t coming back. The narrative of ascent once so forceful and certain is in now very clearly in terminal decay, a slow downward spiral towards yet another cautionary gaming tale about squandered opportunities and abused trust. About the perils of trusting micromanaging asset fetishists and the tragic, underappreciated virtues of proper scope design and competent project management. Chris had a chance to make history here, perhaps the most opportune chance in this history of gaming. And through deficits of both competence and character, he absolutely blew it, and the price he will pay for his hubris, deceit, greed and stupidity is that the history he could’ve written will instead be written for him.</p><p>The best he can hope for at this point is that some salvageable mediocrity survives and that he’s cast as fool in an epic tale of gaming folly. It would be a generous appraisal and it’s more truly stated that any man who profits so handsomely by lying so often for so long is a villain at heart. <strong>His only plausible defense is one he lacks the self-awareness and humility to make — that he was lying to himself the whole time, too, and because he so normalized the act of lying to himself, his employees and his backers, and because he drove away the very sorts he needed to call him out, there was no one left to correct him.</strong></p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/WAh2Upm.png></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/iTUm6Tq.png></figure><p><img src=/img/emotes/thunk.gif alt="thunk emote" class=sa-emote></p></blockquote><p>Holy shit I thought that was just a insane citizen but its a head CIG employee lol.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>The Titanic</div><blockquote><p>Right now it’s still an “us vs them” war, but I think it’s starting to lessen.

Also they were pressed on the use of 6dof tracked controllers and they officially ruled out ever supporting them. Really the only way SC sees any type of VR action beyond some shitty vorpx pukeport is if they make a completely separate branch of the game for it that does not mix with the main branch.

Travis was an experienced developer and producer who had worked on both Diablo 2 and 3. Chelsea was a similarly experienced Blizzard customer support manager, making for quite a power couple. Their appointments did much to soothe early backer concern at the runaway stretch goals.</p><p>Travis worked as a producer at CIG until June 2015. His solid experience and measured tones on CIG videos did a lot to shore up backer confidence during the long period when Star Marine was &ldquo;weeks, not months&rdquo; away. He left quietly, ostensibly to go back to Blizzard. A certain amount of backer unease followed his departure.</p><p>Chelsea on the other hand became a community icon, a regular on CIG&rsquo;s videos and the face of the customer support unit&rsquo;s concierge team. She became popular with backers for quick, friendly responses and above all being willing to hook whales up with rare and valuable ships if they missed a sale. In those days that was ships like the Idris-M and Scythe. Chelsea&rsquo;s popularity stemmed from the way she wouldn&rsquo;t just grant refunds for these rare and expensive ships, but she would put a refunded ship back in &ldquo;stock&rdquo; and let another backer buy it if they asked.</p><p>Being a CS rep, and also being a feeeeeehmale, this brought her to the attention of CIG&rsquo;s truly wonderful and caring fanbase <img src=/img/emotes/barf.gif alt="barf emote" class=sa-emote></p><p>Some of the first rumblings of disquiet on these forums started when Chelsea began to share stories about the kind of people who kept calling up the customer support teams and asking very inappropriate questions - including, yes, the infamous backer who apparently kept asking for video footage of the female CS team members&rsquo; feet. This was the time &ldquo;The Wulge&rdquo; got his nickname from apparently having a habit of sending the CS team dick picks long before he targeted fellow players. Goons began to joke about how CIG were clearly longing for release day so the community managers wouldn&rsquo;t have to suck up to whales and could start purging the creeps. Sadly these days we know better.</p><p>Alas, Chelsea&rsquo;s popularity with the backer base also put her in the sights of people who simply could not tolerate sharing the spotlight. These were also the days when attractive female CS reps who appeared in CIG videos had a nasty tendency to disappear if they drew too much viewer attention away from the High Queen of Marketing. The exact details aren&rsquo;t known, but the body language in the videos spoke volumes - spoke them so loudly that even the backers began to pick up on it and ask questions on the RSI forums. In one video (I think an anniversary stream or something; it was an all-hands team thing) Chelsea was spotted visibly rolling her eyes as Sandi spoke, and after that the writing was on the wall. She left at the same time as her husband, again going back to her old job at Blizzard.</p><p>Chelsea is still fondly remembered by the backers to this day, particularly those who bought in at concierge level. Quite a few complaints and concern threads (and more than a few refund requests) have cited how later customer services teams are &ldquo;nowhere near as good as Chelsea&rdquo;.</p><p>Chelsea would be replaced for a few months by another female deputy customer services rep, supposedly a &ldquo;Deputy Head of Marketing&rdquo; - a woman who would in turn depart during a purge of suspected leakers around the time of the AEGIS Potato debacle, when someone leaked the name of an upcoming new ship just prior to CitizenCon only for CIG to frantically rename it to try and discredit the leak. Someone left a placeholder up on the website and the CIG store proudly began selling the &ldquo;AEGIS POTATO&rdquo; until someone typed the new name in.</p><p>TheAgent-sourced (and Bootcha-supported) rumours said she quit on the spot in disgust after witnessing her colleagues being fired by Sandi for refusing to hand over their mobile phones to CIG&rsquo;s private detective agency so they could be checked for leaks.</p><p>After that Sandi began tweeting about training a new CS team in Europe en masse, the same people who would turn out to be running the ticket queue that labelled backers as &ldquo;snowflake&rdquo; or &ldquo;goon&rdquo; and cross-referenced them with their suspected usernames on other sites. But the saga wasn&rsquo;t over yet!</p><p>In early 2016, perhaps in a sharing mood or perhaps in a moment of drunken weakness, Bootcha let slip a little more info from his time as a CIG investor. We knew that after Derek&rsquo;s first spectacular leaks, Ortwin and Chris panicked and brought in a private detective agency (hired with backer money) to try and flush out the leakers. Apparently their report fingered none other than…Travis Day.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll never know if Travis really was a source of some early leaks (Bootcha&rsquo;s comments were pretty sceptical and suggested he thought that the agency were just trying to find a patsy to justify their fee), but again the reasoning told us all we needed to know. Supposedly, the reason they considered Travis the most likely leaker was that he had a motive to seek revenge on Sandi for her poor treatment of his wife.</p><p>Truly, Cloud Imperium Games is a wonderful working environment.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>One more one!</p><p>&ldquo;Moved to Concern&rdquo;</p><p>A nasty little trick popular with moderators on the old RSI forums. To defuse rising backer angst, Lesnick &amp; co created a &ldquo;concern&rdquo; subforum for angry backers to post about things that bothered them about Star Citizen. This kept them out of more public-facing forums where backers might be put off buying ships. Needless to say, any thread expressing dissatisfaction with Star Citizen (or even one where the conversation turned in a heretical direction) would be swiftly yanked from the public eye and moved to the Concern forum.</p><p>However once moved to Concern, the other shoe would drop. There were very strict rules about threads created in the Concern forum, one of which was that all threads had to have a poll so Citizens could vote on whether or not they felt the thread highlighted a major issue (and other laws about speaking respectfully etc). A thread created elsewhere would of course not meet the requirements…and so be immediately locked. Sometimes the hapless thread OP would be banned, too.</p><p><strong>Backers quickly learned not to create threads that could even potentially be deemed concern threads, lest they be banned by association. A rather grim and pathetic culture sprang up whereby a backer raising a concern would feel the need to start their post with two or three paragraphs reaffirming their support for the project and their loyalty to CRoberts, lest the mob descend and an RSI moderator wade in to brand the thread with the mark of Concern.</strong></p><p>This trick became no longer necessary when the fanbase was unceremoniously moved to Spectrum in mid-2016 and the old RSI forums were &ldquo;archived&rdquo; and quietly deleted. Spectrum came with a full suite of mod tools enabling a moderator to make a heretical thread (or even a user&rsquo;s entire post history) disappear with a click of a button, and angry backers all moved to Reddit instead.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p><a href=http://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/11/17/star-citizen-video-creates-new-cities/>shill site</a></p><blockquote><p>WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU PLAY</p><p>Every Star Citizen trailer features 100% in-engine content using actual game assets.
