Especially if they&rsquo;re on a slope, and the objects ping-pong between being &lsquo;stationary&rsquo; in one update, then &lsquo;sliding&rsquo; the next update. I&rsquo;ve never seen a physics engine that doesn&rsquo;t have this problem, at least a little.</p><p>The developer has to be diligent in keeping the physics objects simple, using as few physically simulated objects as possible, and clearly define when and why they should move, and when and why they should be stationary. If it&rsquo;s not possible to rigidly lock an object, the jittering needs to be smoothed, clamped or hidden somehow. For example, in KSP, ships had a tendency to jitter and slide down slopes. So if you park your spaceship on a slope, the game will apply a deliberate counter-force to stop this. I&rsquo;ve had success with monitoring a physics object for small angular accelerations, and if the accelerations are small enough, just applying a make-believe torque to stop it. It&rsquo;s particularly hard to stop jitter whenever a force and counterforce equilibrium needs to be achieved, like in the case of a suspension spring pushing back against gravity, or a car sitting on a boat that is held up by buoyancy. Ideally, you just want to declare when an object is &lsquo;stationary&rsquo; and freeze it.</p><p><strong>SC is turbofucked because the ship is a collection of physical objects (many of which interpenetrate), the players are <em>also</em> physical objects, you can park vehicles in ships, and the landing gear suspension is never is allowed to &lsquo;lock&rsquo; like in ED. The ship always has a bunch of erratic forces acting on it, with a bunch of erratic counterforces and, like you said, these counterforces can be delayed by an update or have a discrepancy with the server.</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/pa.gif alt="AP's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p><strong>Worth Clicking:</strong><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=//www.youtube.com/embed/opdNVWIireQ style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><strong>(video: ship violently shaking)</strong></p><figure><img src=http://i.imgur.com/Tr0S6jf.gif alt=http://i.imgur.com/Tr0S6jf.gif></figure></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>:redditor 1: I think it&rsquo;s gotten so bad that his wife has left him, he is completely off his meds (his own admission), and literally has locked himself away in his apartment.</p><p><strong>Redditor 2:</strong> He may not have an apartment for much longer.
