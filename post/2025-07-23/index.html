A pitfall of using an aging engine, all the exploits have been found and nicely packaged for the consumer. Want to be a ghost? Fire from across the system?

The same thing I use to game-genie my way through single player games?</p><p>That&rsquo;s a real bad look, wow.</p></blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/spergin.png alt="commando emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p><strong>The Gateway: Anti-Cheat Bypass</strong></p><p>The entry point for all the client-side hacks mentioned is a laughably simple, publicly documented bypass for Anti-Cheat. By adding a single line to the Windows hosts file, you can block Anti-Cheat from communicating with its authentication servers. The game launcher is configured for a &ldquo;soft fail,&rdquo; meaning it launches the game anyway, but with Anti-Cheat completely disabled.</p><p><strong>ESP / Wallhacks:</strong> These cheats display player names, health, distance, and outlines through solid objects. The new information shows this extends to ships, NPCs, turrets, cargo, and even individual lootable items and containers from extreme distances. This is only possible because the server is sending entity data to the client for objects that are not in the player&rsquo;s line of sight. The cheat simply renders this data.</p><p><strong>Aimbots:</strong> We&rsquo;re seeing everything from subtle aim assist to blatant snap-to-target aimbots for both FPS (head/chest lock) and ship combat. The problem is compounded by the game&rsquo;s own powerful ESP feature, which can make it difficult to distinguish between a legitimate tool and a third-party cheat.</p><p><strong>Physics &amp; State Manipulation (The God-Tier Hacks):</strong> This is where the server&rsquo;s trust in the client is most severely abused. The
&gt;! [REDACTED] suite includes a terrifying array of features that should be impossible:</p><p><strong>Teleportation:</strong> The ability to teleport items and loot containers directly to your position from thousands of meters away for remote looting. Also includes player teleportation to any location on the map and, most critically, a &ldquo;One Position Kill&rdquo; (OPK) function that teleports all hostile targets to the cheater&rsquo;s crosshairs for instant death.</p><p><strong>No-Clip:</strong> The ability to fly or walk through solid objects, with adjustable speed for both player and ship.</p><p><strong>Inventory &amp; Weapon Hacks:</strong> Reports of gear being stolen directly from living players are confirmed by these cheat features. They also include unlimited backpack weight, unlimited ammo, no recoil, and no spread.</p><p><strong>God Mode / Instant Kill:</strong> The cheat menu shows options like &ldquo;Super Threat (Instant)&rdquo; and reports of entire squads dying simultaneously confirm that clients can send malicious packets telling the server that other players are dead.</p></blockquote><p><figure class=smilieposter><img src=/img/emotes/spergin.png alt="commando emote"></figure></p><blockquote><p>I think this is now CIG&rsquo;s biggest test.

The server must be the sole authority on game state. Player position, health, inventory, and hit registration must be calculated and validated server-side. The client cannot be trusted. This is a massive engineering lift, but it is the only permanent fix for the client-side hacks detailed in Section 2.</p><p><strong>Proactive Detection:</strong> Server-side analytics should be implemented to flag accounts with statistically impossible metrics (e.g., accuracy, headshot rates, aUEC-per-hour) to identify cheaters and RMT operations that slip through other defenses .</p><p>The integrity of the Persistent Universe depends on addressing these foundational issues, not just the symptoms.
