People on the PTU have observed the effect of a degenerated &ldquo;spin lock&rdquo;. A spin lock used to control access to a shared resource when multiple threads are trying to work on it, such as a file or a memory space. It allows for very fast resource transfer between thread, but threads waiting for the resource are consuming a huge amount of CPU while waiting. It&rsquo;s useful as long as each thread doesn&rsquo;t wait long for the resource, otherwise it becomes a huge performance drain on all CPU cores</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/emotes/tinfoil.gif alt="tinfoil emote" class=sa-emote></p><div class=poster>Derek Smart</div><blockquote><p>Well, bad news.

Add to that the way CryTek treated their staff during their recent financial crisis, trying to convince them not to act on missing paychecks (which in Europe can cause a loss of ability to get compensation in case of bankruptcy), was pretty shitty.
