I know it might be the NPC walking into the ship but I&rsquo;ve been thinking - since we know everything is shrunk down, how small is the bullet? How small of an object can you track in Cryengine? How can you have any kind of precision with let&rsquo;s say, everything shrunk down 200 times? Assuming that you&rsquo;d use 9mm bullets, that would make them 0.000045m, or 45 µm (micrometers). That is stupid small, and I doubt that the engine can handle sub-milimeter precision. So, how can the game know where the bullets actually are and have any sort of reliable gunplay, if it has to kinda guess every bullet position?</p><p>The answer is &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t&rdquo; and it is the most satisfying thing to uncover another layer of their design flaws and technical debt.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/giphy.gif></figure><p>lifts working as planned</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>I finally figured out what CIG’s written reports remind me of: those student projects where nobody did anything meaningful for a few weeks and now have to give a progress report in front of the class.

Chris thanks some woman named Leah for all the CitizenCon planning work. So it’s not just that Sandi is out, it’s that other individuals are being acknowledged for doing what was formerly her job.</p><p>The movement on the Cryrekt lawsuit may be why Squadron had to pull a disappearing act again.</p><p><strong>A WORKING THEORY OF THE PRESENT</strong></p><p>This is sloppy but figured I’d throw it out there.</p><p>Squadron was the centerpiece of Citcon 2015 and 2018. It completely and conspicuously vanished in 2016 (thanks <em>Infinite Warfare!</em>) and 2019.</p><p>I’m going to assume the Calders invested because they were sincerely sold on the pitch of a can’t fail, celebrity packed single player game from the creator of Wing Commander. There’s a chance they had more nefarious reasons, of the sort that Cayman Island money is famous for, but the Holiday 2017 Livestream sure looked like an earnest, maybe desperate all-hands-on-deck sales pitch from Chris and his entire leadership team. The awkward nervousness of it, the weird unsolicited assurances (like Chambers assurance that the cinematics team was exclusively a Squadron resource and not used on Star Citizen), it felt pretty authentic and a little desperate.</p><p>So if you’re a reclusive and historically ruthless billionaire dropping $46 million into what you think is going to be a single player movie game, you’re not doing a handshake deal. You’re going to protect yourself and your filmmaker son from getting chumpatized.</p><p>Only weeks after the check clears, CIG has a string of big publicity problems. If the Calders weren’t familiar with its notoriety before this, they sure are now. Chris stumbles through them all summer, but decides, in the interest of proving to the Calders that CIG is the next big thing, he’s going to stage the biggest CitizenCon ever. He’s even going to throw some money at the Redbull infotainment team and have a slick advertorial doc shot during the show. Chris buys a full marketing package from them to do what Sandi can’t. As part of the deal, Redbull is also going to deploy a battle-tested, high octane streamer to hype this turkey to the max after the documentary drops at year end, and they’ll pump more advertorials about Rex In 2019 to Newsweek and Polygon and anyone else selling adspace designed as light news. This will serve to reassure backers and the Investors alike eventually. <em>(No Jade, Rex didn’t play 6 hours a day for months on end in 2019 because he didn’t have anything better to play. Sorry, Astro girl!)</em></p><p>Back to the summer of 2018.</p><p>Because Chris is spending so very much on this whole confidence projection effort (huge venue, slick doc, future streamer and advertorials), he gets the brilliant idea he should paywall the Citcon event and get some of that money back. This brilliant idea outrages fans and average gamers alike and thrusts CIG right back into the self-own spotlight Chris was trying to get out of. It produces even worse PR than Chris got in the summer and eventually he’s forced to back off the plan. So CitCon turns out costly both to the company and to its reputation with its new billionaire investor.</p><p>“Get your crap together, Chris.”</p><p>Stuff happens. Controls are asserted. Sandi’s on the way out by the end of 2018, though no official announcement has been made even a year later. 2018 sees Chris downsizing their weekly fan content, with ATV turning into a dimlit, low-budget Landoshow. 2019 crawls along, with CIG missing their less ambitious targets and Squadron stalling and entering radio silence mode one year after it was the centerpiece of CIG’s marketing AND investor pitch. But Chris did at least task his Devteam at the end of 2018 with building a new game mode just for Rex and future Rexes. Chris wants and needs a better game for hucksters for hire to pitch, something that cuts out all the bloat of SPAAAAACE! and keeps the tempo up for viewers. We got a glimpse of this nearly yearlong development priority at CitCon and, well, if it isn’t exactly Planetside 2 level fun yet, it’ll at least solve design problems made obvious during Rex’s year of streaming. <em>(The dude spent more time pacing the decks of his ships while in transit to battle zones than actually fighting)</em>.</p><p>Crytek’s lawsuit moves slowly in the background, presenting its own battery of risks, including to Squadron’s release. But like Sandi’s forced removal, it’s <em>unspeakable</em>, so he takes the stage and pretends two of the most important things of the last 7 years of CIG’s life don’t exist and he hypes their tailored made streamer game that nobody expected or asked for. (He’s going to need it in 2020 because his hucksters for hire will if they’re gonna talk new backers into this psychological macrotransaction trap.)</p><p>Whatever is really going on behind the scenes at CIG, it seems like we’re seeing a weakened Chris. Controls are being asserted and risks are finally being felt. After years of chest pounding and crap talking, years of date hyping and target missing, a humbler Chris has emerged.</p><p>I wonder how the board meeting went, and what the Calders are thinking about their $46 million dollar experiment about now?</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/Scruffpuff.jpg alt="Scruffpuff's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>I won&rsquo;t go overboard and say they&rsquo;ll be out of business in 3 months or something like that, but I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious where things are.</p><ul><li><p>They still can&rsquo;t make the game.

But it’s certainly a priority to get as much of this in your hands as possible in 3.8 and 3.9.</p><p><strong>There is no global weather simulation at the moment, the demo used a fixed ‘wind map’ which rotated around the planet, though even this simple setup is surprisingly effective. I’d imagine we’ll release a simple setup such as this before introducing a full sim.</strong></p><p>The visor and canopy effects are only set up on specific ships and helmets thus far, so won’t make it for 3.8 (at least not on all helmets and ships), but hopefully soon after (just a question of art resources).</p><p>The biome accumulation system has only just started work, and frost on the players suit was the first use of it.
