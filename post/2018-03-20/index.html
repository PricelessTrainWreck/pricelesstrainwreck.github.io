Roberts berated detractors raising a ruckus about Star Marine even when he knew things had fallen apart with Illfonic, and when confronted by a journalist who knew how they fell apart, Roberts pulled the ol’ <img src=/img/emotes/iiam.gif alt="iiam emote" class=sa-emote> defense. He sees a good guy and genius looking back at him in the mirror and must always do so and anything that would ugly that perception gets the “You are dismissed” treatment so he can continue as he prefers.</p><p>How hilarious is it that even after the chastening of several hours of probing questions from Julian Benson that Roberts said:</p><p><a href=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/09/23/inside-the-troubled-development-of-star-citizen>http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/09/23/inside-the-troubled-development-of-star-citizen</a></p><p><em>&ldquo;Where we&rsquo;re at now, I&rsquo;m much happier,&rdquo; said Chris Roberts, posed the same question. &ldquo;I feel more in control of the beast.

We’d seen Chris tour the lavishly, tackily furnished CIG LA in the prior ATV installment. This was at a time when the five-figure expresso machine had finally been confirmed and was much mocked by Derek, Goons and a few other places as “proof” that CIG was a Scam. We saw Erin engage in a tiny act of symbolic distancing in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpalZlE4FC8&amp;t=14m45s">the abruptly tacked-on closer</a>, which conspicuously began with a directed gesture at Foundry’s own modest little coffee machine in their spartan break room. The signal sent was <em>”Not me. Not us.”</em> Erin knows Chris has steered the enterprise into dangerous territory and to the extent he can create distance from that, he has.</p><p>—</p><p>Between the four individuals holding so much organizational power, we see diverse positions on their business practices. What we don’t see and have never seen is real leadership. We don’t see personal accountability. What looks like a scam emerged naturally from the interplay of the dysfunctions and pathologies and since it’s gotten them this far, who would want to stop it?</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>It is a scam, but Chris doesn&rsquo;t scam with the intent of scamming.</p><p>Chris has simply bit off more than he, or anyone, can chew. He <em>wants</em> to make Star Citizen. This is his dream game, his magnum opus - and many see his vision for the end-all be-all space sim as the greatest thing that could ever happen in the gaming industry and put their faith in him.</p><p>If he were successful it would be. I would buy it and so would everyone here, Derek included. If he delivered on every promise, every ship, every space martini - if he actually built the world he envisions then it might be the best game ever made.</p><p>But he won&rsquo;t, because he can&rsquo;t. Nobody can. The dream is too large, too ambitious, too demanding. You can&rsquo;t model a universe that actually compares to the real universe. You may as well aspire to build the Matrix - at least that is only modeling one world.</p><p>It&rsquo;s too much information for any server, any processor, or any graphics card to take. Star Citizen can be done, but it won&rsquo;t be possible for another 50 years or so.</p><p>–&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>As the years plod on, his grand designs continue to churn in mediocrity. He is stressing the engine to its limit, spending resources hand over fist to achieve the vision in his head. <strong>The way he does this is to carefully construct microcosms of the game he wants to build.</strong> He shows us these: the sandworm, the pirates on the ship, the marketing blitz which pretends the game is complete. He makes these things and tries to extrapolate from there, getting 0.5% of what he wants before CryEngine shits itself and crashes.</p><p>&ldquo;Small bites, small steps&rdquo; he must tell himself - but those small steps are months which soon turn to years which soon turns to 6 years. The world is moving on without him and his vision. The faithful are losing faith, the money is slowing down, Star Citizen not being released has become the joke. Now he needs to start delivering if he wants to dispel the inevitable decline, and there&rsquo;s nothing to deliver.</p><p>Chris needs to sell spaceships so he can keep the dream alive. He needs SQ42 to be a blockbuster smash success (it won&rsquo;t) so that he gets even MORE resources to dump into Star Citizen.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a scam, not because he wants to grift people of money, but because <strong>he cannot achieve this thing and doesn&rsquo;t realize it.</strong></p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>He still genuinely believes that Wing Commander would&rsquo;ve been a great movie with a bigger budget and more production time. Freelancer would have been the ultimate life-simulator-in-space if the publisher had just kept sending checks and being patient. None of it was his fault, none of it made him reconsider his choices. He remembers the horrible feeling of realizing that the jig was up and he&rsquo;d blown it, and rather than scale down his big dreams to something his limited skills could achieve, he&rsquo;s convinced that all he needs is to do is keep spending someone else&rsquo;s money and keep pushing that day of reckoning further and further into the future: eventually he will bump into the success he feels he is owed, and everything will be perfect.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>i think CIG is facing a new kind of problem.</p><p>A problem on promises, no im not talking about fulfilling those promises.</p><p>Im talking about promising more stuff. They have gotten to the point where they have pretty much promised everything.</p><p>a real life space simulator with immersive handcrafted procedural planets, A AI that can think for itself without using cheaty mechanics like finitive state machines.</p><p>Immersive base building experience with large scale ground warfare that is more realistic/arcadey than anything out there. space combat that is fought in single shard world that has multiple regions and which can support 1000&rsquo;s of players fighting in freelancer/realistic enviroment. Obviously realism is big thing so if you get wounded during space combat a medic will perform surgical operation on you and its going to be more fidelitious minigame than surgeon simulator is. It doesnt end there you can also take care of wounded pets and after release you can give em cybernetic limbs. Not into space/land combat? not a problem theres always the sea, you can go boating and enjoy finding new species in the sea. If your not into fishing you can jump right in and visit one of underwater cities we have planned. Still not satisfied? take a immersive journey on the space train. You can also race the train or be a news broadcaster producing hit news pieces in the verse. Still not satisfied? How about slave trading hot chicks trough unknown wormholes that lead into new systems that haven&rsquo;t been discovered yet. How about drink mixing in luxury yacht after you have traded some slaves. Obviously everything can/cant be earned ingame.</p><p>Feeling tired of star citizen yet? Try sq42 with its groundbreaking story that spans over 60 missions. Obviously its just the start there are 3 more sq42 coming.</p><p>sq42 can be replayed forever thanks to branching storyline it has. Its going to be a masterpiece on par with wing commander the movie. There is also numerous side missions you can enjoy. Or you could just observe AI&rsquo;s serving in the ship to learn details on their live.</p><p>What else could you wish?</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Just a small reminder,Chris flew to one of the studios (first class of course) after demanding one of the art teams set up a room full of art for him to go over.</p><p>He turned up incredibly late after having told everyone that anyone found to be leaving would be fired.</p><p>He came in,walked over to a table of printouts and ripped them into tiny pieces without having said a word to anyone,then left.</p><p>Source : my cousin,who&rsquo;s been working on games for 9 years.</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Virtual Captain</div><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/RB7tCss.png></figure><p><a href="https:youtube.com/watch=qdYS4VXvBoY&amp;t=695">timestamped youtube link (695)</a></p><p>&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know what Gary Oldman got paid and <strong>I see a lot of people on reddit talking about <em>&lsquo;oh you know maybe he did it for free&rsquo;</em> bullshit, he did not do this for free</strong>&ldquo;</p><p><a href="https:youtube.com/watch=qdYS4VXvBoY&amp;t=822">timestamped youtube link (822)</a></p><p>&ldquo;for people that are like <em>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think this games ever coming out&rsquo;</em> bullshit I mean <strong>like they&rsquo;ve already hired professional actors to do this it&rsquo;s not a scam</strong> people&rdquo;</p><p><a href="https:youtube.com/watch=qdYS4VXvBoY&amp;t=1086">timestamped youtube link (1086)</a></p><p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a game yet&rdquo;</p><p><a href="https:youtube.com/watch=qdYS4VXvBoY&amp;t=1167">timestamped youtube link (1167)</a></p><p>&ldquo;if you look at the jobs page some of the listings are from 2017 and that makes me a little bit frankly worried&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;some of these job titles if you&rsquo;re looking at them and you see what they need it&rsquo;s a little bit troublesome&rdquo;</p><p><a href="https:youtube.com/watch=qdYS4VXvBoY&amp;t=1212">timestamped youtube link (1212)</a></p><p>&ldquo;you have to look at Chris&rsquo;s ability [to manage people] I think Chris has had a lot of slip-ups frankly&rdquo;</p><p><a href="https:youtube.com/watch=qdYS4VXvBoY&amp;t=1448">timestamped youtube link (1448)</a></p><p>&ldquo;if I&rsquo;m asked the question &lsquo;is CIG too big?&rsquo; I would have to say hell no like a resounding hell no they aren&rsquo;t in fact make them bigger&rdquo;</p></blockquote><div class=poster>G0RF</div><blockquote><p>He’s definitely been on a journey of discovery with these recent videos.

You <em>could</em> simulate every particle in a person&rsquo;s body in order to have some kind of accurate medical gameplay. Or you could do Dwarf Fortress and have bone, skin, tissue, and nerve layers with some codified interactions between them and various damage types, and specific gameplay penalties when a layer is damaged. Or you could set health to &ldquo;100&rdquo; and give them packs that make it go up by 25 whenever they&rsquo;re hit. You could even write the third option so poorly that it caused your computer to die. That is the Star Citizen way.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>The best I can think is that Star Citizen gives each and every player a limitless dream of what they can do in the universe. Because Chris always says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to every feature question asked - we can safely assume that <strong>any feature the human brain can conjure will be included in the game</strong> (that is if we assume he makes the game as promised.)</p><p>Because of this, we need only calculate the computational power of the human brain, and multiply by the number of backers.</p><p>As it happens, scientists attempted to replicate 1 second of human neurological power on a computer in 2013:</p><p>It took 82,944 processors 40 minutes to compute 1 second of human brain activity. If we convert to get a 1:1 time output, it would take roughly <strong>200,000,000 processors to keep up with the dreams of a single player in real time.</strong> However we are all aware that these people do not have fully functioning brains, so let&rsquo;s drop the required power by 75% to accurately model the simpler systems. That&rsquo;s 50,000,000 processors to keep up with an actual cultist.</p><p>We can project that Robberts expects about a million players to play Star Citizen, but I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s hoping to beat WoW and get numbers in excess of 15,000,000. A conservative 1,000,000 players would take:</p><p>50,000,000,000,000 processors to keep up with their dreams.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><p>Wrong</p><p>Their dreams are largely derivative and relatable</p><p>Maybe account for 100x(brain) power, copying dreams where possible</p></blockquote><div class=poster>Beer4theBeerGod</div><blockquote><p>Star Citizen exists in its current state because there are consequences for failing. Crowd-funding is at its core a hedged bet on the part of the backers, and the developer gets all of the benefits and none of the penalties (so long as they don&rsquo;t commit outright fraud). This also means that upping the ante is a viable solution when things go wrong; the developer still has no consequence for failing and the extra money means there&rsquo;s a chance they might succeed. Actually it&rsquo;s the only solution.</p><p>Meanwhile the backers end up divided into three groups. The first group has checked out and doesn&rsquo;t care; they&rsquo;re the ideal group because they don&rsquo;t ask for anything and by the time they notice the money will be gone. The second group end up disenfranchised and demand refunds; give it to them and they go away. That leaves the third group, the gambling addicts who are constantly chasing the high of when they first discovered Star Citizen and know that the only way that can happen is if they buy more. This is the group that Chris is a veteran of exploiting, the dreamers who are constantly looking for an opportunity to spend more and find something new to dream about.</p><p>So you have a company with every reason to expand scope supported by a community desperate to do anything to make their dream happen. It&rsquo;s phenomenal.</p></blockquote><figure class=goonposter><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar"></figure><blockquote><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/DTth4Ni.png></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/ZkU7gle.jpg></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/2ytVR79.png></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/Sz5jI9t.png></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/kq6ePg5.png></figure><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/YOMnOR1.jpg></figure></blockquote><h2 id=center-as-seen-on-somethingawfuldotcom-https-forums-somethingawful-com-center><center><a href=https://forums.somethingawful.com>As Seen on SOMETHINGAWFULDOTCOM</a></center></h2></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-03-16/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="March Set 6">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2018-03-24/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="March Set 8">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=https://github.com/goonrathi title=GitHub><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/VirtualCapt title=Twitter><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://anchor.fm/star-citizen-argcast title=anchor><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-anchor fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io>GOONRATHI</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/js/main.js></script></body></html>
