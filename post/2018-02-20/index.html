I try to drop 10000 ft. editorial comments in often, in part for the silent lurkers and newer members who might not yet have a big picture grasp on the Counter-narratives we all take for granted at this point.</p><p>I remember when I first joined the thread. Mostly lurking, infrequently commenting. I’d heard things, seen some warning signs, but it was hard to get a handle on what was true because CIG’s Triumphalist Narrative was so dominant. Yet even before Derek launched his July blog there were warning signs, troubling indicators, online gossip, little intrigues. There wasn’t yet a true thread consensus — guys like Octopode and others saw “situation normal everything under control” while voices like AP, Beer, Bootcha, OhDearGodNo, Sorla78 were giving voice to far dimmer and more subversive theories. For me, the Zapruder film was the June 19th 2015 episode of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx1VCIH6sEo&amp;t=22m20s">Reverse the Verse.</a> It captured the dichotomy perfectly — in the foreground, happiness and deference to the wonderful talented VP of Marketing. In the background, perturbation, disgust, intimidation. Even CIG eventually realized how dangerous it was and purged it from their archives, and there we see revisionism, suppression…</p><p>It very quickly became clear just by watching CIG’s propaganda reels that <em>something really is wrong here and they don’t want us to know it.</em> It was all shadows through dark glass back then, at least to me, yet now it’s crystal clear and brightly lit. You just have to care enough to educate yourself and be willing to commit to the effort and you’re rewarded with the decryption key to make sense of the incoherence and contradictions that define CIG’s schizoid tale.</p><p>Anyway, knowing that there are people visiting or lurking here who’ve lost faith in the Triumphalist view yet don’t really yet have a coherent counter theory together, I try to offer summaries here and there. I know I’m not enlightening the regulars by doing so but it’s easy to take for granted what might’ve taken years for regulars here to fully apprehend. I’m just only too grateful the master storytellers in CIG LA spent years too stubborn to change and too proud to back down because the years have been such a bounty of riches and the thread memory and archivists retain it all.</p><p>Many of histories heresies get reclassified as the unspeakable truths of their time and the thread’s will as well. It’s growing obvious to more and more despite the valiant efforts of the Charlie Halls, the David Swoffords, the Joe Blobers, the Gremliches and all the rest who keep fighting to hold the crumbling ruins of the old faith together. Sooner or later there’s too little left to even prop up; it’s just fools and liars pushing dust piles around until the winds finish the job.**</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonindicator><img src=/img/avatars/goons/VirtualCaptain.jpg alt="Virtual Captain's avatar" class=avatarposter></p><blockquote><p>I had a very boring 3 hour skype meeting <img src=/img/emotes/nallears.gif alt="nallears emote" class=sa-emote></p><figure><img src=/img/img_archive/jU4MDHd.jpg></figure></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Oh hey there was that big hubbub over the <a href=https://robertsspaceindustries.com/squadron42#enlist>Squadron 42 mailing list</a>, wasn&rsquo;t there?
