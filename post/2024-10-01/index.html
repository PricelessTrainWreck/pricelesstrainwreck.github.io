The frame rate was balls, I tried messing with settings and it did nothing. My GPU was asleep, my CPU was running slightly more but it seems like there really isn&rsquo;t much multithreading going on. I will, however, admit that the game was better than the last time I played, it didn&rsquo;t crash when I went into the hangar and the tutorial kind of guides you through getting started. You start, it makes you drink food and water which I guess is to teach you that there are mechanics for hunger and thirst and before I did that the turorial was on that step and the door wouldn&rsquo;t open (this is foreshadowing). It guided me through their confusing controls that require you to click on things in the ship, which includes switching some tab that took me a minute to find. I took off and flew into space and was thinking, &ldquo;oh wow this game may be doing something, maybe this is neat&rdquo;. I thought I went into the warp mode but I guess there are actually three ship modes, so I warped to the station it tells you to go to and it came out of that super speed at 23km out or something. So I&rsquo;m flying in and I guess I&rsquo;m still in half super speed mode and so i get close and realize how fast I&rsquo;m going and I tried to turn off whatever mode that is making me GOTTA GO FAST. I fail and slam into the station and explode. And by explode I mean it starts to explode and freezes to like 1 fps and then it tells me I died. I spawn back in my apartment. I&rsquo;m afraid I need to go through the entire tutorial again (which includes buying a gun that I guess is sent to your house) but it still is on the same step. Ok fine, have to run through everything and get to the station but this makes that one guy happy so whatever. I go to open the door. It doesn&rsquo;t do anything. I remember that it was locked before eating drinking, but I&rsquo;m not on those steps. There is no food in the apartment but a bunch of water bottles that weren&rsquo;t there anymore. I delete the mission for the tutorial thinking it would fix it. Nope, door is still locked. Can&rsquo;t open in. Now I&rsquo;m stuck in the apartment forever. I&rsquo;m sure someone would tell me that I just need to delete my character and restart, and it&rsquo;s my fault. To be fair, if you die in real life, I assume you go to some sort of hell and are punished forever. Maybe it&rsquo;s just that?</p><p>Looking forward to trying it again in 2025.</p></blockquote><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>Honestly I don&#39;t really get bugs when I play Star Citizen I don&#39;t know what you guys are talking about. <a href=https://t.co/yGUuOi2yUT>pic.twitter.com/yGUuOi2yUT</a></p>&mdash; DeadlySlob (@Deadlyslob) <a href="https://twitter.com/Deadlyslob/status/1793052948114637204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>meh, the fun was extracted out of that shit long ago. this is rearranging deck chairs on the titanic (which, btw, punches above its weight <img src=/img/emotes/smug.gif alt="smug emote" class=sa-emote>)</p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/avatars/rotgoon.png alt="goon avatar" class=goonposter></p><blockquote><p>Yeah I logged in yesterday and didn&rsquo;t return a shopping trolley.

It manages to penetrate the armor and strikes an internal component, say a power relay node (something else we are working on as part of the pipe system refactor). The power node takes damage giving it a chance to &ldquo;misfire&rdquo; while in use. A few minutes later the node does misfire, blowing its fuse and resulting in it catching fire. The crew of the ship doesn&rsquo;t realize a fire has broken out in one of the side corridors, as they are busily concentrating on fighting the ships attacking them. The fire starts to spread along flammable surfaces, and as the fire starts to engulf other components they also catch fire. The engineer on the bridge of the ship sees his console flash red giving him a warning that several components have failed and looking at his ships schematic he sees a fire has broken out below decks. The engineer decides to seal the bulkhead doors on the corridor to contain the fire but the doors have no power as the power node is out! He comms one of his crew mates to leave his turret and grab an extinguisher and put out the blaze which is slowly creeping towards the power plant room. Fire reaching a ship&rsquo;s power plant or it&rsquo;s ammo stores are two sure fire ways for your ship to go boom. With the physical damage system ships will no longer just explode when their hit points reach zero, they&rsquo;ll explode because something inside them went critical and exploded (due to damage or heat), which then damages everything else. Outside of that damage will affect the ability of the ship to function or it&rsquo;s structural integrity so they also could become a lifeless hulk as much as they could go up in a flash of light. When the crew member gets to the corridor where the fire has broken out is has already consumed a huge amount of oxygen in that &ldquo;room&rdquo; (the corridor) and has released noxious gasses, so the crew member can&rsquo;t breathe and quickly retreats to put on a fire resistant suit and helmet. The engineer in desperation manages to reroute power away from the destroyed node through a secondary node restoring power to enough of the bulkhead doors to allow him to contain the fire. Noticing that there is an external airlock in the sealed off area he opens the airlock, venting the oxygen in the sealed off corridors and rooms to the vacuum of space, depriving the fire of the ability to burn, putting most of it out. By this time the crew member is suitably dressed and can extinguish the fire that made it past the bulkhead door before it can grow again. The engineer then reseals the airlock and allows the life support system to replenish the air in the vented part of the ship. Once done the engineer opens up the bulkhead door allowing the crewmember in with a replacement fuse for the power node, restoring power to that section of the ship, then returns to his turret. It&rsquo;s been a close call but the ship is still alive and in the fight!</p><p>What I describe will be possible once we have finished and deployed the systems we&rsquo;re working on.</p></blockquote><p>Lol I love when Croberts outs himself as never having even touched his own game.
