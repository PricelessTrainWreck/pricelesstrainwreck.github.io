Our first game, Chronicles of Elyria, has been funded, thus far, almost entirely through the pledges and generosity of our backers. But that was never our intent. When we launched our Kickstarter back in 2016, it was with the plan to use the money to hire additional staff, put together a playable demo, and quickly attract publishers who would be willing to fund the remainder of development. So our plan was to use Kickstarter to, you know, kick-start the development process.</p><p>[…]</p><p>But to our great sadness…. with the failure of Settlers of Elyria, and five long months of only limited crowdfunding revenue coming in, Soulbound Studios has officially run out of money. Last night I was forced to do something I never thought I&rsquo;d have to do. I closed the online store, put the SoE map back into read-only mode, and laid off all the employees&hellip;</p><p>Before taking the store down and laying off all the employees I had a long conversation with Vye and Snipehunter. We considered long and hard about launching our Kickstarterversary early this year, and being open with the community about our need for additional funding. We were pretty confident that if we made all of our previous promo items available for sale on the store, and were transparent about our needs, that the community would rally behind us, pledge more support, and sustain us long enough to get more playable content into the hands of our backers. With gameplay that was directly relevant to the aristocracy and nobility, with more information about kingdom and land management, that might have been enough to sustain us until we could get to Alpha 1 and land some investors.</p><p>But we decided not to. While we had no doubt that our backers would come to our aid, we&rsquo;re living in a volatile period in our world&rsquo;s history. With unprecedented changes to society caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, and with economies beginning to suffer all around the world, I made the hard decision not to try and get additional crowdfunding. I knew doing so would mean having to close the studio. But it was the right thing to do. I&rsquo;d rather people spend their money on games they can play now, or better yet, food and shelter, rather than on the continuned development of Chronicles of Elyria.</p><p>So, with no additional funding, the Chronicles now descend into what is often referred to in the monomyth or the Hero&rsquo;s Journey as &ldquo;The Abyss&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Ordeal.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the period in a story where the protagonist reaches their lowest point, and is often marked by a figurative or even literal death, allowing them to travel into the underworld. And so, for the time being, Chronicles of Elyria heads into the darkness&hellip;</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>The game is not dead, it&rsquo;s fuckin dust. It died a couple of years ago when they announced they were switching from SpatialOS. Me and a buddy who pledged said it then and were berated for our opinions. Every few months since then it&rsquo;s been one clusterfuck warning after another and yet some of you butthurt retards kept giving them money for their little virtual vaporware and you want to cry about it?</p><p>Even after this fuck you letter to everyone, there are still some of you who think it&rsquo;s on &ldquo;hiatus&rdquo;.. LMFAO… I guess you also think Grandma is on a hiatus and will dig her dirty old bones up out of Greenview Cemetery and come home to make you a cake?</p><p>Seriously guys, losing money sucks and falling prey to some sorry ass would-be leader who lied to everyone on a constant basis to try and keep from doing real work sucks soggy old man balls, but you are proving that you honestly do not have the mental capacity to wake up and dress yourself the more you post about wanting anything they did open sourced or wanting to see unreleased work. They don&rsquo;t have any unreleased work. They used everything they had and created to try and sucker more of you into giving up more dough. How anyone has given a dime to them after viewing the shitty videos they released the past year and half is beyond me. Anyone who can use UE4 can do more within 3 months than they have produced in 3 years. Fuck, he could have bought a million worth of assets on the Unreal Marketplace and shown off more than whatever the fuck it is they have been showing off.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get mad at my post..
