<p>You see all of 2020 will mostly be a planning year, as they switch from Staggered to Hopscotch development. So anyone who understands game development will know that once Hopscotch methodology is fully implemented in Q1 2021, then development can really kick into high gear. And really this is good and normal for a game to be stalled well into its 9th year of development.</p>

<p>It is a huge, boring, empty room. It has been redesigned two or three times in the five years since it was announced. There is a blue sphere in the middle of the otherwise desolate room. The sphere is featureless. You cannot interact with the sphere. It is literally a placeholder. What is the purpose of the sphere? What possible mapping could you do on a huge blue sphere in a big empty room? Nobody knows. But it is large, and blue. Citizens love the room and are wild about it. The room costs $500+ dollars.</p>

<p>My coworker used to talk about being interested in Star Citizen (he&rsquo;s a sucker for pretty pictures) and I would bring up the more work-appropriate things we&rsquo;ve discussed in the thread, such as how badly the scope has expanded and how many self-imposed deadlines they&rsquo;ve missed. I urged him to at least wait until it was officially released (hah), and recommended other games he might enjoy that would let him live out his fantasies of being a space Fed Ex driver.</p>

<p><strong>He didn&rsquo;t listen, and bought a starter package anyway. Now he&rsquo;s spent $300+ on the game, including getting a second account for his 4 year old kid.</strong> I no longer talk to him about Star Citizen at all if I can help it, because all he wants to do is try to convince me that he made a great purchase.</p>

<p>I feel like a lot of the citizens we mock are like that. There&rsquo;s a plethora of information out there that should make them question whether they want to buy in (or keep buying in), but they don&rsquo;t want to see it. And if they don&rsquo;t want to see it, what more can we do to help them?</p>

<p>At this point I think all we can really do is just sit back and laugh at the situation, and welcome in any citizens who do finally want to stop throwing their money at Croberts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t stick to any idea for longer than 6 months. I mentioned in the past that they chase whatever the big game that&rsquo;s coming out, become so far behind that the sequel to the big game is already underway when they show it off, they go chasing the next big game and the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>The simplest solution to this is to fuck off for 12-18 months, no weekly vids, no cons, no big ship sales each month, maybe a patch or 2 in that time frame at most. Just go away and work on the battlefield knockoff then show it off when you have shit working to a really decent quality by actual video game standards, cause good quality CIG would be on par to steam shovel ware at this point.</p>

<p>But they can&rsquo;t do that, cause any quietness would spook the backers, sales would just stop. It has to be shown as proof of progress and &ldquo;yes we are working&rdquo; on the game.</p>

<p>This battlefield mode will be released get a patch or 2 tops then never worked on again, see Star Marine the supposed &ldquo;core&rdquo; block of what every module was to be connected to. Then it&rsquo;s on to the next thing to part citizens money from their bank accounts.</p>

<p>I have the vivid image in my mind of a Citizen dying decades from now while waiting for the game to release, and being entombed in their SC themed basement sim-pit, as an aged group of a dozen of their surviving org mates gather at Olisar and play taps over the in-game voice channel. One of them turns on FOIP to try to display their emotional anguish, and is instantly deskeletonized as the server crashes.</p>

<p>In a Cayman Islands luxury retirement community, 95 year old Chris Roberts is about to breathe his last. A snow globe containing a model of an Idris falls out of his hand, breaking on the ground as he whispers his last word “fidelity”.</p>

<p>The next day, Lando breaks the news via Skype from a LA IHOP were he went to catch the senior early bird special. The one dev still working on the game from his college dorm room, switches the game’s version from Alpha 43.5 to Beta 1.0 (Chris Roberts Memorial Release).</p>

<p>Star Citizen goes on to have its best funding year yet, even though CIG now only accepts cash mailed directly to a PO Box in Switzerland. Sandi uses the money to get another round of plastic surgery, so she can audition for the part of a 29 year old struggling actress, co-starting in a direct to video re-make of The Perception, with a washed-up Jacob Tremblay fresh out rehab for the fourth time.</p>

<p>The Javelin is the $5k super warship that literally expects more crew than will fit on a single server and hasn&rsquo;t really been seen except for exterior shots in their many, many bullshit promo videos. Implementing it would require enormous server upgrades, in addition to actual capital-ship combat mechanics outside of just &ldquo;More turrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Kraken is the ~$2.5k &ldquo;pocket carrier&rdquo; that they finally ginned up to bilk idiots who&rsquo;d been clamoring for one for years. Making it work would require some kind of flight deck mechanics and collision physics that didn&rsquo;t just give up at the first sign of two grids interacting.</p>

<p>The Idris, of course, is the $1.5k darling and we&rsquo;re all extremely familiar with the saga there. Will never be released for the PU in any kind of workable form due to carrier mechanics, torpedos being broken, requiring too many people/being far too large and complex for the servers/etc. The absolute avatar of ambition before design.</p>

<p>The Polaris is the intermediate $900-or-so ship that&rsquo;s supposed to be a torpedo boat and general single-ship carrier. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything preventing it from being released in &ldquo;Walk around and look at the corridors&rdquo; form except that it&rsquo;s fucking huge and CIG can only seem to produce about one of these ships per year. I&rsquo;d expect it some time in like, 2022 or so if the company somehow manages to carry on that long.</p>

<p>Update: An individual in helpdesk-volunteers suggested that this is an overall MobiGlass issue. <strong>They suggested that I edit my character, then change eye colors.</strong> It seemed very random at the time and completely unrelated but it seems to have worked. I went on a 2 hour mining adventure and my hand didn&rsquo;t get stuck. Normally it would have happened within the first half hour.</p>

<p>This is some solid, well thought out software architecture right there. Whats next? Missiles starting to work if I use another color for my space toilet?</p>
